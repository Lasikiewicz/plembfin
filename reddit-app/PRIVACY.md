# Privacy Policy — Plembfin Release Bot

This Devvit app ("the bot") posts release announcements to r/plembfin. It is operated
by the moderators of r/plembfin for that single subreddit.

## What the bot does

On a fixed schedule, the bot fetches a public JSON file
(`changelog.json`) from the public GitHub repository
[Lasikiewicz/plembfin](https://github.com/Lasikiewicz/plembfin). If it contains a
release the bot hasn't announced yet, the bot submits a text post to r/plembfin
describing that release, and pins it (un-pinning whichever earlier release post the
bot itself previously pinned).

## Data the bot accesses

- The public `changelog.json` file in the plembfin GitHub repository. This file
  contains only release notes - version numbers, dates, and a description of
  code changes. It contains no personal or user data of any kind.
- Public Reddit content in r/plembfin (post listings), to determine which post, if
  any, it previously pinned.

## Data the bot stores

The bot stores one value in its own Reddit-hosted app storage: the version number of
the release it last announced, so it doesn't post the same release twice. It stores no
other data, and does not access, log, or retain any Reddit user's personal information,
messages, or account details.

## Data the bot does not do

- It does not read, collect, or store any Reddit user's personal data.
- It does not make requests to any domain other than the one required to read the
  public changelog file.
- It does not share data with any third party.

Questions can be sent via modmail to r/plembfin.
