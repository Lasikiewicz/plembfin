# Backups

Plembfin has **three backup subsystems** plus a set of pluggable remote destinations.
Schedules and destinations are managed from **Settings → Backup → Local / Remote**
(`/settings/backup#backup-local`, `/settings/backup#backup-remote`); recovery workflows
live under **Settings → Restore → Local / Remote** (`/settings/restore#restore-local`,
`/settings/restore#restore-remote`) (UI in `public/modules/tools-backups.js`).

| Subsystem | What it saves | Format | Files |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Watch-history backups | `watch_history`, `playstate`, `playback_progress` + manifest | gzip JSON (`plembfin-watch-history-<stamp>.json.gz`) | `server/src/utils/watchHistoryBackups.js` |
| Encrypted full backups | Every portable collection, including canonical personal watchlist mutations, provider ledger, queue, runs, and activity (but no provider secret) | AES-256-GCM encrypted JSON (`plembfin-backup-<stamp>.encrypted.json`) | `server/src/utils/plembfinBackups.js` |
| Full export/import | Same portable collections, plain JSON, paged over the API | `plembfin-backup` v1 document | `server/src/utils/backup.js` |

Artwork binaries, poster cache rows, and TMDB metadata cache rows are never included -
they are derived data that rebuilds itself.

The focused watch-history subsystem reference is
[watch-history-backups.md](watch-history-backups.md); this doc covers all backup
subsystems and their shared destination adapters.

## Watch-history backups (`watchHistoryBackups.js`)

Small, automatic backups of just the data needed to restore watch state.

- **Contents** - the three watch-state tables plus a manifest (format/version, app
  version, creation time, row counts, checksum). Poster URLs are excluded (derived
  data, may embed expired tokens).
- **Scheduling** - the elected background worker runs `runScheduledWatchBackup()` and
  `runScheduledRemoteWatchBackup()` once per tick. Each fires daily at its own
  configured time (default 03:00), catching up if the scheduled time was missed: the
  local schedule writes a local backup, and the remote schedule creates a fresh backup
  and uploads it to every enabled destination. Config (`enabled`, `time`, `retention`,
  `remoteEnabled`, `remoteTime`, `remoteRetention`) lives in the `settings` row
  `watchHistoryBackups`; run state in `runtime_state` (`watchHistoryBackups`).
- **Storage** - always written to `data/backups/watch-history/` first: temp file →
  checksum verify → atomic rename. Retention (default 14, max 365) prunes oldest.
- **Restore** - `restoreWatchHistoryBackup(filename, { mode, dryRun })` supports
  **merge** (add missing, newest state wins on conflict), **replace** (clear the three
  tables first), and **dry run** (validate + report expected changes without writing).
  Uploaded files restore via `importWatchHistoryBackupFile`. Restores pause the cron
  sync (`pauseCronSync`, default 10 minutes) so the catch-up sync can't fight the
  restore, and stamp `lastRestoreAt`.
- **API** - everything multiplexes through `GET/POST /api/watch-backups`
  (`handleWatchBackups` in `index.js`): status, list, create, download, upload,
  restore, destination CRUD, destination test, remote list/pull.

The Tautulli one-time importer uses the same local watch-history backup format, but
stages its workflow separately: preview and resolve matches first, create the
recommended pre-import backup (or explicitly skip it), then run the import. The
backup and import stages each show their own progress state in the UI. After a
successful import, Plembfin reports completion and queues the selected targets for
background syncing.

### Remote destinations (`backupDestinations/`)

Watch-history backups upload to destinations on their own daily schedule (the Remote
Watch History Backups card) or on demand via that card's Back Up Now button; encrypted
full backups upload on their schedule or Back Up Now in the same way. Every upload is
best-effort - a remote failure never invalidates or deletes the local file.
Per-destination status (last attempt/success, bytes, duration, error) is recorded in
the backup runtime and shown on the Remote Watch History Backups card. Remote retention
is ordered by the sortable filename and scoped per backup type: pruning after a
watch-history upload only counts watch-history files (remote retention setting), and
pruning after a full-backup upload only counts encrypted full backups (Plembfin
retention setting), so the two types never delete each other's files.

All adapters implement the same contract (`index.js` in the folder):
`testConnection() / upload(localPath, remoteName) / list() / download(remoteName) /
delete(remoteName)`.

| Type | Adapter | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `folder` | `folder.js` | none - local path (useful for mounted NAS storage) |
| `webdav` | `webdav.js` | basic auth |
| `s3` / `backblaze` | `s3.js` | access key + secret, built-in SigV4 signer (AWS S3, Backblaze B2, MinIO…) |
| `onedrive` | `onedrive.js` | Microsoft device-code OAuth (user supplies an Azure app client ID; app-folder scope; refresh token persisted via `persistSecrets`) |
| `dropbox` | `dropbox.js` | manual no-redirect OAuth code flow; refresh token persisted |

Destination records (`{ id, type, label, settings, secrets }`) live in the settings row
`watchBackupDestinations`. Secret fields (`password`, `secretAccessKey`, `appSecret`,
`refreshToken`) never reach the browser - every API response redacts them to "is-set"
flags (`loadBackupDestinationsRedacted`). Backup transfers use a 60-second outbound
timeout (vs the configurable 10s default).

The settings UI currently exposes Backblaze B2 destinations. Each configured target is
shown as a status card; the trailing **+** card opens the type picker, and selecting a
card opens an edit dialog with Save, Test, and Delete. The B2 form uses the adapter's
canonical `region`, `bucket`, `accessKeyId`, `prefix`, and `secretAccessKey` fields.
Secret values are never prefilled; a configured placeholder means leaving the field
blank preserves the stored application key. Multiple B2 destination records are
supported.

## Encrypted full backups (`plembfinBackups.js`)

Nightly encrypted snapshots of the entire portable backup document.

- **Encryption** - AES-256-GCM, key derived with PBKDF2 (SHA-256, 100k iterations);
  passphrase must be ≥ 12 characters and is required - there is no plaintext mode.
- **Passphrase storage** - manual backups can use a one-time passphrase that is never
  persisted. Scheduled local or remote encrypted backups require "remember passphrase"
  to be enabled; existing stored passphrases are treated as remembered for backward
  compatibility and can be removed by unchecking the remember option and saving.
- **Scheduling** - `runScheduledPlembfinBackup()` runs from the same scheduler tick,
  daily at the configured time; retention default 7 (max 365). Config lives in the
  settings row `plembfinBackups`.
- **Remote mirroring** - optional; runs with the daily scheduled backup when remote
  mirroring is enabled, or immediately via the Remote Plembfin Backups card's Back Up
  Now button. Reuses `pushBackupToRemotes` from the watch-history subsystem, so the
  same destination list applies; the aggregated attempt/success/error status across
  destinations is shown on the card.
- **Storage** - `data/backups/plembfin/`. **Warning:** these backups contain
  media-server URLs, usernames, tokens, and API keys (that's what the encryption is
  for).
- **API** - `GET/POST /api/plembfin-backups` (`handlePlembfinBackups`): status, list,
  create, download, delete, restore-from-server, save settings.

## Full export/import (`backup.js`)

The portable-format engine the other subsystems build on, also exposed directly:

- `GET /api/backup/export` (`handleBackupExport`) - pages collections out via
  `exportCollectionPage` (cursor + limit ≤ 500) so the browser can assemble a full
  plain-JSON backup for download (Settings → Backup / restore → Backup settings).
- `POST /api/backup/import` (`handleBackupImport`) - imports batches via
  `importCollectionBatch` (≤ 250 documents per batch, optional per-collection reset).
  Importing watch-state collections bumps `dataVersion` so derived caches reload.
  Watchlist collections are restored as local desired state: provider observations are
  downgraded, queue success/lease state is reset, a restore revision is recorded, and
  delivery pauses until the user explicitly selects **Publish restored watchlist** in
  Settings → Sync → Sync Tools.

Full backups include `personal_watchlist`, its append-only mutation/tombstone history,
provider ownership observations (including Plembfin-owned playlist/container IDs),
non-secret queue/run state, and redacted activity. Provider URLs, users, and other
connection settings remain in encrypted full backups as before; browser portable export
does not include provider credentials. Restore never treats old provider success markers
as current truth and never publishes automatically.

Watch-history-only backups intentionally do **not** include personal watchlist rows,
mutations, provider ledgers, queues, or runs. Restoring one cannot change the Watchlist
page or provider watchlists.
- The `portableValue`/`reviveValue` helpers keep timestamps portable, and the format
  also revives `_seconds`-style timestamps found in old exports.

## Watch-history importer (Settings → Import)

Separate from backups: `POST /api/import` (`handleImport`) ingests watch records from
CSV/JSON files (e.g. Trakt exports, `scripts/exportPlexHistory.js` output). Frontend
flow in `tools.js` (`parseSelectedFiles`, `renderImportPreview`, `startImport`) parses
files in the browser and posts records in batches.

### Tautulli history import (Settings → Connections)

The Tautulli importer is an explicit, one-time migration tool at
`/settings/connections#tautulli`. Configure the Tautulli `/api/v2` URL and API key,
select exactly one Tautulli user, and preview completed movie and episode rows.

Before a confirmed import Plembfin creates a local watch-history backup with the
reason `pre_tautulli_import`; remote mirroring follows the existing backup setting
when requested by the operation. The import is additive and does not delete or write
to Tautulli. Rows below Tautulli's watched threshold are reported as incomplete and
are not imported. Unix-second timestamps are converted before entering the normal
history pipeline, and missing dates fall back to the release date only when a new
local record is needed.

The final backup-and-import confirmation is shown in Plembfin's in-app dialog, including
the multiline target summary and any possible-match plays that will remain unimported.
After confirmation, the Connections page keeps the operation visible as `Importing...` and
then reports `Import complete` while explaining that Plembfin is now syncing the imported
watches to the connected media servers.

The merge is identity-aware and same-local-day: provider IDs are compared
independently, episodes can match by show/season/episode, and movies can match by
title when identity is unambiguous. A different local day is not automatically a rewatch -
see the next section. Imported
rows use the `tautulli_import` source and retain the selected Tautulli user, source
item ID, history-import event, and source timestamp in provenance. The Tautulli
`rating_key` is provenance only; it is local to that Plex/Tautulli installation and is
not used as a portable provider ID.

#### Approximated dates and rewatches

Plembfin holds a lot of approximated watch dates: release-day anchoring, episode timing,
and older manual backfills all write a round clock hour rather than an observed time. A
real Tautulli playback timestamp often lands a day either side of one of those, which a
strict same-calendar-day merge would treat as a second viewing. Measured against a real
library, that silently duplicated dozens of plays.

Two rules handle it:

- **A real play within two days of an approximated record is the same viewing.** It merges
  and is counted as `merged_approximate_date`. A round clock hour (minutes and seconds both
  zero) is the tell; a genuine playback timestamp lands on one about once in 3600 plays.
- **Two plays of the same item within 31 days, where neither side looks approximated, are
  ambiguous.** Rather than guess in either direction, they go to the review list below as a
  *possible rewatch*.

Further apart than 31 days, a second play is treated as a genuine rewatch and imported
without asking.

#### Possible-match review

The review list holds two kinds of question, each labelled:

- **Possible match** - the play matches more than one existing record, so which one is it?
- **Possible rewatch** - the play sits close to one existing record, so is it a second
  viewing or the same one recorded with a different date?

Neither is ever merged on a guess or imported on a guess. The preview lists each one with
the records it could belong to, and the import stops short of it until an administrator
picks one of three resolutions:

- **Use this record** - treat the play as already represented by that existing record.
  Nothing is inserted; it is counted as reviewed and merged.
- **Import as a separate play** - the administrator is saying this is a genuinely
  distinct viewing. A new row is inserted and counted as reviewed and imported.
- **Skip this play** - drop it from this import entirely.

Because the rewatch question usually has the same answer across a whole import, the panel
also offers **All separate rewatches** and **All same viewing**, which apply to every
undecided possible-rewatch row at once. They never touch a row the administrator has
already decided, and never touch an ambiguous-match row, which has several candidates and
no single sensible bulk answer.

Leaving a row undecided is itself safe and is the default: it stays in review, is not
imported, and is reported as such in the final summary. Decisions are addressed by a
content-derived key rather than by position in the preview, because the commit re-reads
Tautulli and a play added or pruned in between would otherwise shift a decision onto a
different record.

#### Where an import is sent

The importer does not ask which servers to project to, and deliberately so. Plembfin is the
source of truth, so the scheduled sync reconciles Emby and Jellyfin with imported watches
whether or not the import pushed them itself - and both receive the original Tautulli
playback date, so the watches land in the right place in their history either way. A
per-server opt-out would imply a choice that does not exist.

Plex is the one server where a setting genuinely prevents the data arriving:
**Sync historical watched items to Plex** in Sync Tuning. When it is off, the importer says
so before the import runs rather than reporting it afterwards, because imported items may
then stay unwatched in Plex. When it is on, there is nothing to ask and no notice is shown.

Each target is still reported per import as `will receive this import` or `skipped by the
historical sync policy`. A policy skip is a deliberate outcome, not a failure: the row's
telemetry records it as skipped so the scheduler's pending-dispatch sweep never retries it.

Plex is **not** excluded merely because Tautulli points at the same Plex server. An
already-watched Plex item is detected and reported as `already matching` instead, which is
accurate rather than a guess from the machine identifier. See [settings.md](settings.md).

## Frontend (`public/modules/tools-backups.js`)

Settings → Backup / restore → Backup settings renders four schedule cards - local and remote, for watch-history
and encrypted Plembfin backups - each with an enable toggle in the card head, its own
time/retention (or passphrase) fields, a runtime status readout, and Save/Back Up Now
actions at the bottom right, plus the Backblaze destination cards and edit dialogs.
Settings → Backup / restore → Restore renders local/uploaded/remote backup choices and restore status
(`setBackupTransferState`).
State lives in
`state.watchBackups`, `state.remoteBackupFiles`, `state.backupImport`,
`state.activeBackupsTab`.

## Disaster recovery without the app

Everything lives under `data/`: `plembfin.db` (SQLite), `media/` (artwork),
`config.json` (credentials/secrets). Copying that directory and restarting is a
complete manual backup/restore - see the Backups section of
[hardening.md](hardening.md).
