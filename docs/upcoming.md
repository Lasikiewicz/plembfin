# Upcoming Page

The Upcoming page shows a continuously scrollable calendar of historical and future TV
episode air dates for tracked shows. It uses the same TV metadata split as detail pages:
TheTVDB supplies season, episode, title, and air-date structure, while TMDB identity is
used for show navigation.

| `public/modules/upcoming.js` | Week-range scrolling, month navigation, client-side search, calendar rendering, poster hydration, show navigation |
| `public/app.js` | Route binding for `/upcoming`, element binding, module initialization |
| `public/index.html` | Upcoming nav item, page shell, month controls, search field, calendar container |

| `server/src/index.js` | Dispatches `GET /api/upcoming` |

## Backend

`GET /api/upcoming?month=YYYY-MM` returns episodes airing in the requested
month. The handler:

1. Returns the requested month immediately when it exists in
   `data/upcoming-calendar-cache.json`.
2. On a cache miss, reads the TV Shows library and `data/next-airing-cache.json`.
3. Uses the next-airing cache to skip irrelevant shows for future months, and scans all
   tracked shows for the current or a historical month.
4. Fetches merged TMDB/TVDB show details to resolve the TVDB id.
5. Reads the current and next season for current/future calendars, or all known seasons
   for a historical calendar, from the TVDB season cache.
6. Stores and returns episodes whose air dates fall within the requested month.

The scheduler checks the persistent calendar cache every 10 minutes. It progressively
builds the previous 24 months once and checks the current month plus the next 12 months
for changes every 6 hours. A check only rewrites a month when its episode data changed;
historical months are not periodically refreshed. Up to 60 month results survive server
restarts, so revisiting a month does not repeat metadata pulls.

Each month records the tracked shows included in its result. Opening a cached calendar
after another show enters the library fetches only that missing show and merges its
episodes immediately. The browser revalidates the current month every time the Upcoming
page opens, while the response remains a fast local cache read when no shows were added.
Other months are fetched once as the visible week range reaches them and then reused for
the rest of the session.

## Frontend Behavior

The calendar renders one block per month, stacked in date order. A block is a sticky
month heading (e.g. "July 2026") pinned below the topbar while that month is in view,
followed by that month's Monday-start week rows. Each row is a 7-column grid of day
cards — the same card style used across the app for a single day (weekday name, date
number, episode entries). A week that straddles a month boundary appears in both blocks,
and the days belonging to the other month render as invisible spacers, so every date is
drawn once, under its own heading, with the columns still aligned. Confining each heading
to its own block is what stops the headings stacking on top of one another at the top of
the scroller.

Opening the page (via nav click or direct URL) always puts the current week in the top
row, regardless of where a previous visit left off. The month either side is already
rendered, so the user can scroll up into the past or down into the future straight away.
Scrolling near either end extends the loaded range automatically — one month at a time,
up to 24 months either side of the current month — and fetches the newly visible months
from `/api/upcoming` on demand. Scrolling upward preserves the user's viewport position
as older months are prepended.

The topbar title tracks whichever month's heading is currently pinned below the topbar.
The Previous/Next arrows step one month back or forward from that month and land it as
the topmost month, with its heading pinned directly under the topbar; Today returns to
the current week the same way. All three extend the loaded range first if needed, and a
jump to the last loaded month appends further months below it — otherwise there would be
nothing under the target to scroll against and it would come to rest partway down the
page rather than at the top. The jump is instant rather than animated, and scroll events
are ignored briefly afterwards, so the month the arrows step from is always the month
that was just selected.

At `<=760px`, week rows collapse to a single-column agenda list and empty or
outside-month day cards are hidden so only days with episodes are shown. Weeks with no
visible days take up no space but still hold their place, so Today and the month controls
stay accurate.

The search box switches the page to a dedicated results view: a flat, month-grouped list
of every matching episode (filtered by show title, episode title, or an episode code
such as `S2E4`) across all months currently cached, including a 12-month lookahead that
prefetches in the background while typing. Clearing the search returns to the normal
scrollable month grid.

Posters use `posterMarkup()` and `hydratePosters()` from `public/modules/images.js`, so
the standard local poster cache and fallback pipeline applies.
