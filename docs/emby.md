# Emby Integration

How Plembfin talks to Emby: webhooks in, API calls out, plus scheduled catch-up
polling. Read [architecture.md](architecture.md) first for the big picture.

## Configuration

Settings → Media Servers → Emby uses account setup by default. Plembfin sends the server
URL, username, and password directly to that Emby server, verifies the returned user, and
stores only the encrypted user-scoped token. The password is never persisted.

Manual setup remains optional; its values are stored in the `settings` SQLite row and env
vars `EMBY_SERVER_URL` / `EMBY_API_KEY` / `EMBY_USER_ID` act as defaults:

- **baseUrl** - reachable *from the Plembfin server machine*
- **apiKey** - an Emby API key (Dashboard → Advanced → API Keys)
- **userId** - the Emby user whose watch state is tracked and written

All three are required when Emby is enabled in manual mode (`validateConfig`). Only one
mode is active: completing account setup removes the stored manual key, while saving
manual setup switches Emby back to manual mode. Requests authenticate with the
`X-Emby-Token` header.

## Inbound: webhooks

Emby posts JSON to `/api/webhook?token=<webhookSecret>`. **Enable "Send All
Properties" on the Emby webhook** - without the full item payload, events can arrive
without enough title/type/progress data to record a watch.

`parseEmbyWebhook` (`parsers.js`) derives the phase:

- `playback.start` / `playback.unpause` / `playback.progress` / `playback.pause` → `active`
- `item.markplayed`, or a userdata-saved event with `Played=true` → `completed`
- `item.markunplayed`, or `Played=false` → `unplayed`
- `playback.stop` → `completed` at the watched threshold (90% by default), else `ended`

`item.markplayed` and userdata-saved events are also tagged `playedFlagOnly`, because
Emby fires them whenever anything sets the played flag - including Plembfin's own
outbound sync - and can deliver them hours late. They are dated from the item's
`LastPlayedDate` rather than arrival time, and never record a rewatch for an item
already marked watched. See [webhooks.md](webhooks.md#rewatch-detection).

Unlike Plex, Emby **does** send mark-unplayed events, so unwatch propagation works
purely through the webhook - no extra listener is needed.

## Inbound: scheduler polling

Every minute `fetchLiveSessions` polls `/Sessions` for Now Playing. The catch-up sync
(every 15 minutes by default) pulls:

- **Recently watched** - `fetchEmbyWatchedItems` (user's items filtered to
  `IsPlayed`, ordered by play date) → `syncRecentlyWatchedFromEmby` records watches
  whose webhooks were missed.
- **Resumable items** - `fetchEmbyResumableItems` (`/Users/<id>/Items/Resume`) →
  `syncRecentlyResumableFromEmby` replicates resume positions to the other platforms.
  Episode rows include series provider IDs so cross-server lookup can resolve the
  series before selecting the matching season and episode.

**Enabled by default** - set `EMBY_JELLYFIN_UNWATCHED_POLL_ENABLED=false` to disable it. Every
5 minutes (`EMBY_UNWATCHED_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`), **unwatched reconciliation**
(`checkEmbyUnwatchedStatus`) re-checks up to 5 items Plembfin thinks are watched via Emby
against Emby's current played flag. Emby's webhook natively reports `Mark Unplayed`, so
this is a backstop for a missed or misconfigured webhook, not the primary detection path -
mirrors `checkPlexUnwatchedStatus` in [plex.md](plex.md), but Plex needs that poll as its
*only* unwatch signal since its webhook can't report unwatch at all, and its per-item
lookup is a single cheap call, so it stays enabled by default at a one-minute cadence over
a larger batch. Emby runs available provider-ID searches concurrently and keeps a
connection/user-scoped ten-minute identity index for resolved series and episode
coordinates. Concurrent sibling episodes join one in-flight resolution and reuse one
episode-list fetch; operations that inspect watched state still fetch fresh `UserData`.
Confirmed empty discovery is cached only briefly, while transport failures remain retryable.

Playback positions use Emby's tick units (1 tick = 100 ns); `scheduled.js` converts
with `ticksToMilliseconds`.

### Items flagged played without a play date

Marking an item watched over the Emby API - which is exactly what outbound playstate sync
does - sets `UserData.Played` to `true` but leaves `PlayCount` at `0` and writes no
`LastPlayedDate`. Emby returns those items in the recently-watched list, so a propagated
watch comes back on the next catch-up poll looking like a watch with missing metadata.

`watchedAtForEmbyLikeItem` never invents a timestamp for a dateless item, because doing so
would turn an existing library into a burst of new watch rows after a restore or first
connection. It separates the two cases:

- **`Played: true` with an explicit `PlayCount: 0`** - marked over the API, nothing to
  ingest. Ignored silently; counted only when `LOG_VERBOSE` is set.
- **`Played: true` with a real play count but no date** - a genuine data gap. Reported as
  one aggregated line naming the affected titles.

An install whose Emby library was populated entirely by outbound sync will therefore have
every played item fall into the first case, and the recently-watched poll will record
nothing from Emby. That is expected: those watches are already in history under the source
platform that reported them.

## Outbound operations (`embyClient.js`)

| Function | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `findEmbyItems` | Locates library items by provider ID (`AnyProviderIdEquals` with `imdb.` / `tmdb.` / `tvdb.` terms), falling back to title/year search; episodes resolved through the series |
| `markEmbyPlayed` / `markEmbyUnplayed` | `POST` / `DELETE` on `/Users/<userId>/PlayedItems/<itemId>` |
| `setEmbyProgress` | Writes a resume position via the item's UserData, retaining the source progress date so Emby's Continue Watching feed can order and include it |
| `markEmbyUnplayedById` | Unplay by item ID (used by unwatch propagation) |
| `fetchEmbySeriesEpisodes` / `fetchEmbyEpisodes` | Episode lists for season-level operations |
| `fetchEmbyWatchedItems` / `fetchEmbyResumableItems` | Feeds for catch-up sync |
| `fetchEmbyPersonalRatingSnapshot` | Reads rated movies, series, and episodes for the isolated personal-rating snapshot worker |
| `setEmbyPersonalRating` / `clearEmbyPersonalRating` | Writes or clears a personal rating without changing played state or resume progress |

A `not_found` result is reported as "skipped - no matching item" in sync telemetry:
the item isn't in Emby's library, which is normal for non-mirrored libraries.

## Artwork

Emby poster URLs are built from `/Items/<id>/Images/Primary` with the image tag
(`embyLikePosterUrl` in `liveSessions.js`, `configuredImageUrl` in
`public/modules/images.js`). The server-side poster pipeline caches a resized local
copy - see [posters-artwork.md](posters-artwork.md).
