# Application speed Phase G matrix - 18 September 2026

The release-verification matrix for
[`plan/application-speed-remediation.md`](../../plan/application-speed-remediation.md),
taken after step 49 on the `develop` working tree. It covers the 12 main routes plus Ludwig,
Reacher, Bad Grandpa, and A Quiet Place, six samples per route per population, two
back-to-back populations, the first round of each population discarded.

## Method

- **Harness:** [`scripts/browser-route-benchmark.js`](../../scripts/browser-route-benchmark.js),
  run in the user's signed-in Chrome 153 profile. The app sends `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, so
  samples load in one same-origin popup window; the harness reads that window's Navigation,
  Paint, LCP, Resource Timing, and `plembfin:detail-primary-ready` entries and never handles
  credentials.
- **Document populations:** full document loads with a unique `?bench=` query, paced 1.2 s
  apart. A sample settles after 800 ms without new resources (and, on detail pages, after the
  primary-ready mark), capped at 12 s.
- **SPA populations:** one `/about` document per population, then `history.pushState` +
  `popstate` to each route (the path the app's own navigation uses). Time is measured from the
  push to the end of the last response the transition issued.
- **Server:** `npm start` (`ROLE=all`, the default combined web + worker process) with
  `PLEMBFIN_DEV_NO_CACHE_ASSETS=1`, so every document load re-downloads the versioned shell
  (a cold asset cache). Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, Trakt, and TMDB were configured and reachable.
- The load event on this server fires at about 80-100 ms, before the module graph finishes, so
  it is not treated as the user-experience metric (section 7 of the plan). FCP, LCP, the
  settled request inventory, and the detail primary-ready mark are reported beside it.

## Cold document loads (`ROLE=all`)

Population A / population B medians. Shell = the document plus every non-API, non-image
resource.

Across the 160 measured samples: **TTFB median 8.8 ms, p95 19.3 ms, max 166.3 ms**; slowest
load event 354 ms; **0 loads over 5 s**; 0 HTTP 429; 0 HTTP 5xx. One `/tvshows` sample hit
the 12 s settle cap because its poster grid kept loading; its timings are still valid. Ten
samples were taken while the controlling tab was hidden, which affects pacing only.

TV detail total transfer was 583-606 KB and movie detail 584-594 KB, all under the 2.0 MB
budget.

0 transitions over 5 s, 0 settle-cap hits, 0 HTTP 429, 0 HTTP 5xx. An earlier SPA attempt
the same evening recorded zero requests because Chrome's 250-entry Resource Timing buffer had
filled; the harness now enlarges the buffer and that attempt is not used.

## Gate results

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Document TTFB p95 <= 500 ms (localhost) | **Pass**: 19.3 ms over 160 cold samples |
| No navigation stall above 5 s | **Pass**: 0 of 192 document loads and 0 of 192 SPA transitions |
| Main-route load <= 2.0 s | **Pass**: slowest load event 354 ms; slowest LCP 792 ms (`/history`) |
| TV detail primary ready <= 2.5 s; <= 30 API; <= 35 images; <= 2.0 MB | **Pass** cold and SPA: 706-750 ms cold, 213-224 ms SPA; 14-16 API; 21-24 images; about 0.6 MB |
| Movie detail primary ready <= 2.0 s | **Pass** cold and SPA: 275-289 ms cold, 33-77 ms SPA |
| Critical shell <= 35 requests / 600 KB / 1.75 MB (Dashboard and About, the Phase C gate) | **Pass**: Dashboard 35 / 350 KB / 1.71 MB; About 25 / 275 KB / 1.43 MB |
| Two populations within 15% (load and ready time) | **Ready time passes** (every detail page within 6%). **Load passes on 13 of 16 routes**; `/` (-15.9%), `/discover` (-16.2%), and `/movies` (+15.4%) differ by 14-16 ms on medians of about 85 ms, at the timer noise floor. Recorded as a measured exception, not a pass. |

Not a gate but worth recording: the heavier route shells are Settings (52 / 514 KB / 2.33 MB)
and the detail pages (46 / 475 KB / 2.21 MB). The plan's shell budget is written for the
first-paint shell; these routes are above it once their own route graph has settled.
