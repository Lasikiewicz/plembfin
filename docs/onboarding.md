# Guided first-run setup

Plembfin replaces the old "generated password printed to the console" dead end with a
one-time account claim, followed by a resumable `/setup` wizard. This page covers the
claim flow, the setup wizard, and how to reach either one again later.

## Pristine-install account claim

On a brand-new install with no `ADMIN_PASSWORD` set and no in-app credentials yet, the app
shows **Claim this Plembfin instance** instead of the normal sign-in form. No password is
generated or logged anywhere - the first administrator sets their own username and
password directly.

- The claim endpoint (`POST /api/auth/claim`) is atomic: if two browsers submit a claim at
  the same moment, exactly one wins (inside a SQLite immediate transaction) and the other
  gets a neutral `CLAIM_CONFLICT` response with no indication of what the winning
  credentials were.
- While unclaimed, every API endpoint except `GET /api/ping`, `GET /api/changelog`,
  `POST /api/login`, `POST /api/logout`, `GET /api/auth/status`, and `POST /api/auth/claim`
  returns `403` with `code: "CLAIM_REQUIRED"`.
- The claim endpoint shares a rate limiter and the same cross-site `Origin` check as
  `/api/login`, plus a short randomized delay, to blunt brute-force and timing attacks.
- Deployments that set `ADMIN_USERNAME`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` never see the claim screen - they
  keep the normal sign-in flow, and claiming is skipped entirely (`isClaimRequired()`
  returns `false` whenever `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set or credentials are already
  in-app-managed).
- Existing or upgraded installs are detected automatically and marked as already-claimed
  the first time the server boots against that data directory - if it has an existing
  media connection, watch history, a configured metadata key, or in-app-managed
  credentials, it's treated as pristine-complete and the claim screen never appears.

## The `/setup` wizard

After claiming the account (or signing into a fresh environment-managed install), the app
opens `/setup`: a step flow covering media servers, metadata, webhooks, an optional Trakt
connection, background imports, and a final review. Every action in it calls the exact
same endpoints and Settings dialogs used elsewhere in the app - there is no separate
setup-only configuration path.

- **Media servers** - reuses the same Plex/Emby/Jellyfin connect-and-test modal shown from
  Settings → Media Servers. No server is actually required - Plembfin also works from
  manually marking titles watched (via search), so this step can be skipped like any other
  optional one.
- **Metadata** - TMDB save/test, plus a note on which providers (TheTVDB, Fanart.tv) are
  already available through Plembfin's built-in project keys.
- **Webhooks** - the same per-provider setup instructions and webhook URL shown in
  Settings, with a self-attestation checkbox per connected server. See
  [`docs/webhooks.md`](webhooks.md) for the full guide.
- **Trakt** (optional) - the same device-authorization flow as Settings → Import. Skipping
  it carries a reminder onto the dashboard checklist.
- **Background imports** - once a server passes its connection test, Plembfin
  automatically starts pulling its watched status in the background (the same "Import
  Watched Status" pull already offered from Settings → Sync → Force Sync, scoped to that
  one server). Unchecking the box on the server's card cancels the in-progress pull and
  marks it opted-out; re-checking it starts a fresh pull. These pulls run concurrently
  across servers and continue in the background even after setup is closed - none of them
  push anything outward, so they don't take the same lock a full Force Sync push does.
- **Trakt baseline import** - same idea, using the same first-sync path Trakt's regular
  poll cycle uses once a connection's baseline snapshot isn't complete yet.
- **Setting Plembfin as the source of truth** (pushing local watch history outward) is
  intentionally *not* offered inline in the wizard. It's a destructive, confirm-gated
  action, so the wizard links to Settings → Sync → Sync Tools, where the existing
  preview/confirm/lock/cancel flow already lives. The wizard does surface whether it's
  even possible yet (disabled with an explanation when local watch history is empty).
- **Review** - a summary of account security, connected/tested servers, metadata,
  webhook acknowledgements, and Trakt status, each linking back to its Settings section.
  No item here is required to finish - a build with no tested server shows a neutral
  "no server connected, tracking will be manual" notice rather than blocking completion,
  since `POST /api/setup/complete` (`handleSetupComplete` in
  `server/src/routes/onboarding.js`) doesn't require one either.

### Resuming and reopening

- Leaving the wizard early (**Exit to Settings**) doesn't mark it complete.
- The sidebar shows a **Complete onboarding** entry point on every page while setup isn't
  finished, alongside its own **×** control to dismiss it permanently. It disappears on its
  own once the wizard has actually been finished (a tested server isn't required for that)
  or once a media server has been connected and tested directly from Settings without ever
  finishing the wizard.
- Settings → Tools → **Reopen Onboarding** reopens `/setup` at any time, including after
  it's been completed - useful for revisiting a step (e.g. adding a second server) without
  touching anything already configured.
- Progress is stored server-side (a `settings` row keyed `onboarding`, not browser storage
  or cookies), so it survives a refresh, a different browser, or a different admin session.
- The wizard's overview step offers a **Restore from backup** shortcut for migrating an
  existing install onto a fresh one, before connecting anything. It reuses the exact same
  local-upload/server-stored and Backblaze B2 restore tools as Settings → Backups → Restore
  (see [`docs/backups.md`](backups.md)) rather than a separate implementation.

### Dashboard checklist

Once setup is complete, the dashboard shows a short **Finish setting up Plembfin**
checklist for anything still outstanding - TMDB, per-server webhook acknowledgement,
Trakt, Seerr, and an encrypted backup/credential-key reminder. It's derived server-side
from canonical configuration on every load, not from anything the wizard "remembers", and
disappears once every item is resolved or dismissed.
