# Plembfin Documentation

This directory contains the technical reference for Plembfin's current architecture,
behavior, configuration, operations, and integration contracts.

> **System map:** [architecture.md](architecture.md) describes the application flow,
> configuration, data model, and repository file map. The topic documents below define
> the detailed behavior for each subsystem.

## The most important mental model

This is a **self-hosted Node.js application** with no cloud functions or external
database. The default `ROLE=all` deployment runs the web UI, API, and per-minute
scheduler in one `node server/server.js` process. The split Compose profile can run
separate `web` and `worker` roles against the same local SQLite file and media volume;
a SQLite lease elects exactly one scheduler owner.

Data written to the database is always in the same file regardless of where you run
the app. There is no "works locally but not in production" because there is no
separate production environment - you run the binary directly, or in a container
via `docker compose up`.

Common gotchas:
1. **Media server reachability** - Plembfin contacts Plex/Emby/Jellyfin from the
   machine it runs on, not from the browser. A URL that the browser can reach but
   the server cannot (e.g. a different LAN segment or a VPN-gated address) will
   fail silently for the background sync while appearing fine in the UI probe.
2. **Webhook secret in URL** - The webhook endpoint requires `?token=<webhookSecret>`
   in the URL. Omitting it returns 401. Copy the full URL from Settings → Media servers → Webhooks.
3. **Config persistence** - Credentials and settings are stored in `data/config.json`
   (generated on first boot) and in the `settings` SQLite row. The Docker volume mount
   at `/data` must be persistent across container restarts or settings will reset.
