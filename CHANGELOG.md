# Changelog

Release history for Plembfin. This file covers published releases on `main` only -
for the current pre-release build on `alpha` or `develop`, open **Settings → About**
in a running instance, which lists that channel's build history separately.

## v0.12.6 - 27 August 2026

Docs - Check GHCR Cleanup isn't running before any push

### Major Bug Fixes

- Stop updateWatchRecord's playstate rollback timing from racing
- The known-flaky test (updateWatchRecord rolls the old media_key's playstate back to a survivor) was exposing a real bug, not just test noise: getPlaystateForMediaSync's title-based fallback can surface either an old or a migrated media_key's playstate row for a shared title, and updateWatchRecord picked between them with fresh Date.now() calls a few statements apart
- When enough intervening work crossed a millisecond boundary, the newer write's timestamp would non-deterministically outrank the correct rolled-back row, so a Fix Match correction on a title-duplicate item could report the wrong watched state for the leftover, uncorrected identity
- Reused the single updatedAt timestamp already captured for the row update across every playstate write in the same updateWatchRecord call (both the watched_at date-edit path and the identity-change rollback path), removing the timing dependency entirely
- Verified with 40 back-to-back isolated runs of the previously-flaky test (0 failures, versus roughly 1-in-10 before) plus a full clean test suite run

### Tweaks

- Check GHCR Cleanup isn't running before any push
- Added a precondition to Push to git, Force to alpha, and Force to main: verify ghcr-cleanup.yml isn't mid-run first, since it deletes images from the same GHCR package every push publishes new tags to and its own docs warn against running it in parallel against the same package

## v0.12.5 - 27 August 2026

Chore - Bump alpha build for f3f3d9b

### Tweaks

- Bump alpha build for f3f3d9b

## v0.12.4 - 27 August 2026

Fix - Publish the release image in the same job that commits the changelog

### Major Bug Fixes

- Publish the release image in the same job that commits the changelog
- The prior split (a separate publish-current job gated on the changelog-bump commit re-arriving as a trigger) never actually ran: a commit pushed with the default GITHUB_TOKEN doesn't trigger another workflow run, so this release's 0.12.3 image was never built or pushed to GHCR at all
- Moved the Docker build/push and Discord notification back into the same job that writes and commits the changelog, so every push to main reliably publishes exactly one image
- Manually published 0.12.3 as a one-off stopgap via the existing workflow_dispatch build so the current release isn't left without an image
- Corrected docs/development.md to describe the single-job flow

## v0.12.3 - 27 August 2026

Docs - Refresh dashboard, media, and stats screenshots; add Sync Activity

### Major Bug Fixes

- Stop duplicate release image builds and add GHCR tag cleanup
- Fixed the release pipeline building and pushing the Docker image to GHCR twice per push to main; only the final job (which runs against the already-committed changelog/version bump) now builds and publishes it
- Added a weekly scheduled workflow that prunes old numbered develop-* and alpha-* image tags (keeping the newest 15 of each) and deletes dangling untagged images left behind when the latest/develop/alpha tags move
- The cleanup workflow starts in dry-run mode so nothing is deleted until a run has been reviewed
- Documented both changes in docs/development.md
- Restore the test suite to git tracking
- Removed test/ from .gitignore; it was added in commit 3d5b85b4 at the same time all 89 test files were deleted from git tracking, so the suite has existed only on local machines since - a fresh clone or CI checkout had zero test files, and npm run build's node --test step was silently running against nothing while still reporting success
- Re-added all 93 files currently under test/ (91 test files plus shared helpers) so the suite ships with the repo again and CI actually exercises it

### Tweaks

- Refresh dashboard, media, and stats screenshots; add Sync Activity
- Replaced the now-playing, media, and stats screenshots with current captures of the app
- Added a new Sync Activity screenshot and README entry, matching the existing Sync Activity hub feature
- Move settings layout conventions into docs/frontend.md
- Moved the orphaned root-level 'layout defaults.md' into docs/frontend.md as a new Settings Card Shell section, since it wasn't linked from any doc index
- Corrected docs/frontend.md's settings-card padding claim while merging: the base .settings-card padding: 1.5rem rule only applies to help-column cards, since a more specific selector overrides it to 0 for any card inside the main column (which is what layout defaults.md was actually describing)

## v0.12.2 - 27 August 2026

Docs - Link Discord and Reddit communities in README

### New Features

- Post release and alpha-build changelogs to a Discord channel
- New scripts/notify-discord-release.js posts a Discord embed built from the newest changelog.json (main releases) or changelog.alpha.json (alpha builds) entry
- Update-changelog.yml and docker-publish-alpha.yml each call the script as their final step, using a DISCORD_RELEASES_WEBHOOK repo secret
- No-ops quietly with no failing build when the secret isn't set, so forks and clones without it configured are unaffected
- Supports a --dry-run flag that prints the embed instead of posting, for checking formatting without a webhook
- Documented the new step and the required secret in docs/development.md

### Tweaks

- Link Discord and Reddit communities in README
- Added Discord and Reddit links to the top navigation row
- Added a Community section linking to the Discord server and r/plembfin subreddit

## v0.12.1 - 27 August 2026

Fix - Correct rewatch and Plex echo sync bugs, clarify webhook setup

### Major Bug Fixes

- Correct rewatch and Plex echo sync bugs, clarify webhook setup
- Fixed a bug where rewatching a show on a new day could be silently discarded and left showing a stale watch date instead of recording the new watch
- Fixed a bug where marking an item unwatched in Plembfin could be immediately overwritten by a delayed "still watched" signal echoed back from Plex
- Settings and onboarding now correctly show Plex needs no manual webhook setup, and add a warning to disable Plex's "Refresh library metadata periodically" scheduled task, which can otherwise reset watched state during its own maintenance window
- Fixed the Emby webhook setup instructions, which pointed to the wrong menu path
- Onboarding now shows the Emby and Jellyfin webhook setup guides even before those servers are connected, and shows the same Trakt "sole bridge" warning already shown in Settings
- Added a "Required" badge to the TMDB metadata card during onboarding
- Removed the raw webhook URL and background scheduler endpoint displays from Settings; the webhook URL is now shown inline within each platform's own setup guide

## v0.12.0 - 26 August 2026

Feature - Filter Sync Activity to failed items and fix dispatch telemetry accuracy

### New Features

- Filter Sync Activity to failed items and fix dispatch telemetry accuracy
- Add a click-to-filter toggle on the Sync Activity failed-count pill so it shows only failed rows on the current page, click again to restore the full page
- Show the real dispatch outcome in a background-queue retry's telemetry instead of a generic "sync completed" message regardless of what actually happened
- Correct the published v0.11.2 changelog entry to describe the guided onboarding release and use the New Features / Major Bug Fixes / Tweaks grouped layout instead of a flat, mistitled bullet list

### Major Bug Fixes

- Fix target-status telemetry lines prefixed with "Target " (written by the scheduled background queue) that the Sync Activity parser was silently failing to match, leaving target results blank

## v0.11.3 - 26 August 2026

Chore - Retrigger release CI after GitHub Actions incident

### Major Bug Fixes

- Group main release changelog entries by impact
- Settings -> Changelog and the generated CHANGELOG.md now sort a new main release's bullet points into New Features, Major Bug Fixes, and Tweaks sections instead of one flat list
- Documented the section-grouping behavior in the release pipeline and architecture docs

### Tweaks

- Retrigger release CI after GitHub Actions incident

## v0.11.2 - 26 August 2026

Feature - Guided onboarding and faster in-place media management

### New Features

- Add guided setup and harden media sync
- Add one-time administrator claim and a resumable guided setup flow for pristine installs
- Add safe background library imports, setup status UI, and managed connection recovery
- Keep movie pages responsive across large multi-tab batches and preserve legacy unwatched links
- Support browser-native middle-click navigation from the sidebar
- Refresh watched dates and unwatch actions immediately after successful changes
- Clarify Trakt import progress and settle terminal partial or skipped dispatches
- Stop tracking the local test directory and add it to gitignore
- Add poster three-dot overflow menu and fix live-update scroll resets
- Added a three-dot overflow button on hover for every poster card outside the media detail pages, offering Edit watch date, Fix match, and Mark unwatched
- Marking an item unwatched from the grid now dims the card with a Removing animation and removes it in place instead of reloading the whole page and jumping back to the top
- Fixing a match from the grid menu now updates the card in place instead of opening the media detail page
- Live updates from Trakt, other devices, or background syncs now refresh the Movies and History grids in place instead of resetting them to the top
- Fixed posters that could get stuck on their loading placeholder if their card scrolled into view after the page's data had already loaded
- Movies page data now always bypasses the browser cache so a mutation is reflected immediately instead of for up to five minutes
- Failed or skipped sync destinations in the Sync Activity list can now be retried individually
- Unwatch detection during scheduled sync now tracks when Plembfin last learned about a watch record instead of relying on the media's reported watched date, so newly received watches are not missed by the safety net
- Group release notes by impact
- Show New Features, Major Bug Fixes, and Tweaks as distinct sections in the app and generated changelog.
- Preserve maintenance and documentation notes during branch promotion instead of dropping them when features or fixes are present.

### Tweaks

- Update onboarding plan with architectural and security recommendations

- Prevent metadata or telemetry updates from reviving an older watched state over a newer unwatch
- Keep destination-specific Force Sync operations from changing unselected Trakt history
- Keep fresh partial playback in Plembfin when Emby or Jellyfin return Played false or stale dates, while preserving newer explicit unwatches

- Serialize cross-process media-server state writes by canonical title identity and fence expired lease owners
- Hold stale Trakt changes for re-check while allowing genuine changes after the protection window expires
- Cover remove-add gaps, split processes, wrong-ID aliases, sparse metadata, lease theft, rollback, and safety holds
- Record a fresh watched transition when an older watched alias coexists with a newer unwatched canonical pointer
- Prevent Trakt reconciliation cache rebuilds from reverting manually restored episodes
- Add the Silo S03E03 provider-id rematch regression
- Resolve canonical playstate from the newest related provider-id alias instead of trusting an older exact key
- Record a fresh manual watched transition when a release-day watch supersedes a newer canonical unwatch
- Cover the Silo S03E03 rematch and manual-watch regression paths
- Manual release-day watch marks now remain watched after reloads when an older build left playstate and history out of sync.
- Manual episode watches now survive reloads while resync-only records remain idempotent.
- Refresh the watched-action browser module and stabilize identity test setup.
- Manual watched changes now persist across rematched episode aliases and fresh show reloads.

- Keep Plembfin manual watched actions authoritative after remote sync replacement echoes.
- Keep explicit Plembfin watched actions canonical after remote callbacks complete.
- Prevent delayed provider callbacks from reversing a watched or unwatched choice made in Plembfin.

- Keep removed Plex watch dates from returning when Plex acknowledges Plembfin's own canonical watched-state write.
- Treat Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin played-flag notifications as acknowledgements when Plembfin already has watched history for the item.
- Use the removed watch row's native Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin item ID to suppress synchronous played acknowledgements while retaining the user's oldest Plembfin date.
- Persist explicit Plembfin watch-date deletions by provider item identity so played-flag callbacks cannot recreate them.
- Compare provider release-date flags and stored ISO watch timestamps using the same canonical UTC value.

- Apply Plembfin deletion tombstones in the direct Plex library notification scheduler before history insertion.

## v0.10.3 - 23 August 2026

Fix - Align episode history identities

- Hide unwatched episode artwork and synopses by default, and add live Sync Activity search, numbered pagination, clearer disabled-state reporting, and neutral activity borders.

## v0.10.0 - 22 August 2026

Fix - Resolve CodeQL alerts and update undici and CodeQL action dependencies

- Edit Watch Date dialog now shows each watch's platform badge (Plex/Emby/Jellyfin)
- TV show control bar: Info moved to the end, the redundant Resync Watched button removed once a show is fully watched, and the top-bar Edit Date button removed
- Expand All/Collapse All moved inline next to the Seasons heading, right-aligned
- Availability pills (e.g. 15/40 Available, 7/40 Available in 4K) moved next to the season count in the Seasons heading
- Plex/Emby/Jellyfin app-link pills moved inline into the ratings row, right-aligned, instead of inside the Media facts panel
- Clicking the poster on a movie or show page now opens it in the photo lightbox
- Cast photo thumbnails now use the same rounded corners as posters
- Media facts panel redesigned: transparent card, real TMDB/TheTVDB/IMDb brand icons in a Ratings row, Plex/Emby/Jellyfin moved into a Watch Now row, Network and Available on show provider icons and link out to TMDB's where-to-watch page for the title
- Network icons now match even when TMDB's network name differs from its watch-provider name (e.g. Prime Video vs Amazon Prime Video); shows resolved via TheTVDB still show network name as text only since TVDB has no logo data
- Poster click now opens the photo lightbox, which renders with rounded corners to match posters
- Dark mode's accent color changed from blue to orange (matching the active TV Shows sidebar tab) across buttons, links, and highlights app-wide; light mode keeps blue
- Theme toggle now fades colors smoothly instead of switching instantly
- Fixed several legacy CSS rules that were silently overriding new sizing/color rules with stale hardcoded values
- Bumped cache-busting version strings for styles.css and the media detail modules so browsers pick up today's changes instead of serving stale cached copies
- Force Sync and Full Sync Watchstates now process independent library items with bounded concurrency instead of one at a time, dramatically speeding up large plans without exceeding the outbound pacing governor's per-server request limits
- Added a Fast Local-Network Sync checkbox to Settings -> Sync -> Sync Tuning (off by default) that raises those per-server limits further for setups where Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin are all self-hosted on the same trusted local network as Plembfin
- Cancelling a Force Sync now lets already-in-flight items finish instead of stopping after a single item
- Documented the new setting in Settings help, docs/settings.md, and the README configuration reference
- Fast Local-Network Sync (and any other pacing profile choice) now actually stays saved instead of silently reverting to standard the moment anything reloads config, which happened immediately after clicking Save
- The same silent-reset bug affected Sync Scope and the Authority (source-of-truth/conflict policy) settings, which are fixed by the same change
- Root cause: the settings loader's env-default merge step rebuilt its config object without carrying these three sections through, so they were treated as never-set and reset to their hardcoded defaults on every read
- Removing a duplicate watch (per-season, library-wide, or a single watch-date delete) could report an episode or movie as fully unwatched even though a real watch of it still existed, because the check only looked for survivors under the exact same media_key as the row just deleted
- Two watch rows for the same episode can legitimately carry different media_keys (e.g. one recorded via a TMDB id, another via an IMDb id only), so that exact-key check missed the surviving row and wrongly propagated an unwatched state to Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, and Trakt
- The check now reuses the same broader same-episode identity match already used to find which rows belong together, so a surviving watch under a different key is correctly detected and the corrected watched state is propagated instead
- Added a regression test reproducing the exact scenario
- Added GET /api/stale-pending-watch-audit and POST /api/stale-pending-watch-repair, generalizing the earlier Trakt play-history incident fix to any watch_history row left with no telemetry or an exhausted retry count from any source, not just the Trakt importer
- The repair only resets retry bookkeeping so the existing scheduler backlog sweep performs a real dispatch and records what actually happened, rather than fabricating a settled telemetry
- Added GET /api/split-identity-unwatch-audit (read-only) to find episodes where a genuine earlier watch is being shadowed by a later unwatched row recorded under a different identity key for the same episode - the aftermath of the deleteWatchDates media_key-split bug pushing a real unplayed mark to media servers, which Plembfin's own unwatched-fallback polls then correctly recorded back in as canonical
- No automatic repair for the split-identity case yet - reverting an unwatch that was genuinely intentional would itself be a phantom watch, so candidates need manual review first
- Documented both tools in docs/scheduled-sync.md alongside the existing Trakt-import repair
- Fixed a real incident: a single Jellyfin burst (a library rescan, metadata refresh, or rate-limited response) falsely unwatched 264+ episodes across dozens of unrelated shows within about seven minutes, propagating the false unwatch on to Plex and Emby before anyone noticed
- applyUnwatchedTransition now tracks a shared, database-backed count of automatic (non-manual) unwatches across Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, and Trakt, and holds back any single one once too many have been recorded in a short window instead of propagating it - this is the one place every automatic unwatch path already funnels through, so it protects all three media servers plus Trakt at once
- Manual actions (marking something unwatched in Plembfin itself, Force Sync, Set Plembfin as Source of Truth, Trakt import) are never affected - only automatic, inbound-from-a-server decisions are rate-limited, and a person can still unwatch as much as they want in one sitting
- Works correctly in a split web/worker deployment since the counter lives in the shared database, not in one process's memory
- Added POST /api/split-identity-unwatch-repair: an explicit admin action that restores episodes already affected by this failure mode (found by the read-only audit added earlier) and re-pushes the corrected watched state to every connected platform
- Documented both the prevention and the repair tool in docs/scheduled-sync.md
- Removing duplicate watches (per-season or library-wide) could wrongly delete a genuinely watched episode and leave it unwatched, if the same episode also had an older, unrelated row that had been explicitly marked unwatched at some earlier point
- The stale unwatched row isn't a countable duplicate watch at all, but duplicate-detection was treating it as one - and since it could sort ahead of the real watch (same or earlier timestamp), it got 'kept' as the supposed oldest copy while the actual watch was deleted as the 'duplicate', wrongly unwatching an item that was never actually duplicated
- Library-wide scan/cleanup and the per-season 'Remove duplicate watches' control both now only ever compare rows that currently read as watched; a later explicit unwatch still shows in the play-history list, it's just never treated as a removable duplicate
- Some episodes affected by the mass false-unwatch incident lost the shadowed watched row entirely rather than just having it shadowed (real cases: The 'Burbs S01E01, Silo S03E02) - every remaining row reads unwatched, so the existing split-identity audit never finds them
- Added GET /api/likely-false-unwatch-audit (read-only): flags an episode where no row currently reads watched but at least one unwatched row came from an automatic source (plex/emby/jellyfin, never manual) with no surviving watched sibling anywhere - the same cascade signature as the split-identity case, just missing its watched half
- Added POST /api/likely-false-unwatch-repair: consolidates every stale row for the episode into one fresh watched record using the oldest row's own date as the best evidence of a genuine watch, then re-pushes it to every connected platform
- This fingerprint is less certain than the split-identity one (an automatic source is also what a genuine unwatch performed directly on a media server looks like), so it stays audit-only until real candidates are reviewed
- Added regression tests for both the audit and the repair
- Removing duplicate watches from a season or the whole library no longer wrongly deletes a watch you meant to keep just because it shares a similar timestamp with the one being removed (e.g. marking an episode watched using the same time as another episode, then cleaning up duplicates) - the episode no longer gets left fully unwatched as a side effect
- Manually marking something watched inside Plembfin (not reported by Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin) now shows a Plembfin badge and logo instead of being mislabeled as a Plex watch
- Deleting a watch date no longer falls back to fully unwatched just because the only row left over happens to carry an old unwatched marker - leaving that row standing (instead of deleting it too) is now treated as confirmation it should count as watched, and it gets pushed out to Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, and Trakt accordingly
- A genuine, more recent deliberate unwatch is never overridden by this - an older row that is still genuinely marked watched always takes priority, so an intentional unwatch is never silently resurrected
- A watch that gets re-dispatched later instead of right when it happened (e.g. the last watch date you leave standing after removing a duplicate) now reaches Trakt with its real recorded date and time, not the current moment - the scheduler's background retry queue was building its outbound payload without that date at all
- Removing or correcting a watch date now records the real outcome of that sync (including which platforms it actually reached) on the affected record, instead of leaving it stuck showing a pending sync forever
- The sidebar sync line is now always visible, reading "Sync - Idle" when nothing is running and "Sync - x of x" while a sync is in flight
- Clicking the sync line opens a new Sync Activity page listing every synced media item in its own row, newest first
- Each row shows where the sync request came from and which apps it was dispatched to, plus each target's result and any failure detail
- Each row has a Download log button that saves that single item's full sync record as a plain-text log
- The Sync Activity page refreshes itself while a sync is running so rows appear as they are dispatched
- Target results are now the app's icon followed by its status instead of pills, coloured by outcome with the failure detail on hover
- Trakt dispatches are named and shown as Trakt with their own icon rather than being labelled Plex, alongside Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, and Plembfin's own manual actions
- The Download log button sits on the same line as the target results
- Clicking a media title opens that title's page, using your library first and the recorded TMDB/TVDB ids otherwise
- Clicking anywhere else on a row expands it to show that item's full log inline, and a background refresh keeps opened rows open
- Mark-unwatched buttons (episode, season, and show) now show "Unwatching..." while removal is in flight instead of the mark-watched "Syncing..." label, and are properly disabled during that time
- Removing a single watch date from the edit-date dialog now marks that specific row as unwatching, so it is not mislabeled if an unrelated sync re-renders the page underneath
- The full search page and the topbar search dropdown now list what is on a connected media server ahead of TMDB/TheTVDB-only matches, instead of relying on incidental result ordering
- Updated docs/media-detail.md and docs/history-search.md to describe the new busy-state tracking and search ordering
- Removed the completed "Unwatching" label and "local results first" backlog items from TODO.md
- Manual unwatch actions (Sync Activity Mark Unwatched, and the Continue Watching clear-progress unwatch) now log their origin as Manual instead of echoing whatever platform the original watch record happened to be sourced from
- Fixes a misleading Sync Activity entry where marking an item unwatched in Plembfin showed "Request came from: Trakt" purely because that item's original watch had legacy provenance pointing at Trakt
- Dispatch behavior is unchanged - this only corrects the recorded origin shown in Sync Activity and the per-record sync telemetry
- Manual watched marks now use the release date when no threshold-reaching playback was detected, while explicit actions can proceed through the interactive sync lane.
- Movies without provider IDs receive TMDB lookup before tracker dispatch.
- Keep queued sync items visible, enrich movie provider IDs, and improve Trakt matching.
- Preserves local watch history rows for TV seasons when upstream providers only index a partial episode list
- Formats season headers to always include the season number alongside any custom season subtitle
- Standardizes rating, network, and app icon dimensions to match the Plex baseline
- Aligns genres across full-width rows when runtime is absent so network and ratings pair cleanly
- Verify administrator username using constant-time comparison to prevent timing-based user enumeration
- Extend TruffleHog secret scanning in CI to run on develop branch pushes and pull requests
- Add automated unit tests for authentication verification edge cases
- Sanitize 500 error responses in HTTP utility to prevent potential stack trace or file path exposure
- Pass console error log arguments separately to prevent tainted format string warnings
- Bump undici to 8.10.0 for upstream stream encoding and socket DNS origin fixes
- Bump GitHub CodeQL action to v4.37.4

## v0.9.8 - 21 August 2026

Fix - Stop mark-watched syncs from blocking unrelated watch actions

- groupShowRows now clusters watch_history episode rows by shared provider id (imdb/tmdb/tvdb), the same union-find approach dedupeMovies already uses for films, instead of grouping purely by title
- Fixes shows like a reboot/revival sharing an exact title with an unrelated original (Scrubs 2001 vs Scrubs 2026) silently blending their episode lists, seasons, and counts into one show page - Scrubs (2026) was showing Season 1 as 24 episodes (the 2001 original's count) instead of its real 9
- Fixed the same title-only matching in mergeShowWithLoadedHistory (client-side merge of the dashboard history preview into a show's episode list) and in queryShowDetail's title-lookup fallbacks, which previously grabbed an arbitrary result once shows correctly split apart
- No watch_history rows are changed; this only affects how episodes are grouped into a show for display
- README overhaul: fixed the Docker Compose quick-start to pull the published :latest image instead of requiring a local clone and build, added a Which version should I run? section explaining the :latest/:alpha/:develop channels, and replaced the stale alpha-to-main branch description with the real develop -> alpha -> main model
- Added CHANGELOG.md, generated from changelog.json by scripts/generate-changelog-md.js and regenerated automatically on every release, so release history is readable on GitHub without logging into a running instance
- Updated CLAUDE.md and docs/development.md's branching sections, which still only documented the old two-branch alpha -> main flow despite this session's develop-branch work; renamed the Merge alpha with main command to the two-step Force to alpha / Force to main it actually is now
- Fixed docker-publish-develop.yml reading a version field from changelog.develop.json that no longer exists (removed in the earlier develop build-counter change), which was silently publishing a bogus :undefined tag alongside the real develop images
- A show reached via /tvshow/:key now delegates into the same TMDB/TVDB fetch-and-render pipeline the /tvshow/tmdb/:id and /tvshow/tvdb/:id routes already use, instead of a separate lighter render that never fetched season-level episode metadata - all three routes now show the same seasons, cast, images, and trailers for the same show
- Fixed watched/unwatched/edit-date actions leaving the page stale or blank when viewing a show reached via its TVDB id: five places across watch-action.js and edit-dialogs.js only knew how to refresh a page by local key or TMDB id, never TVDB, so the post-action reload silently failed on that route
- tmdb/tvdb-id links (search results, recommendations, cast filmography, the upcoming calendar, dashboard cards) now include a readable slug after the id - e.g. tmdb/202555-daredevil-born-again - so they're legible in the address bar immediately, even for a title with no watch history yet; the id alone still resolves the route and old links without a slug keep working
- Fixed a show's displayed tmdb_id preferring a cached-but-possibly-wrong id (resolved by an earlier ambiguous title search and never written back onto any watch_history row) over the id already recorded on the show's own rows, which could permanently override correct data once a bad id got cached - affected the show list, show detail page, and the upcoming episodes calendar
- A show whose every episode was marked unwatched became completely unreachable: gone from the TV Shows grid and dashboard, and its own detail page returned Not Found by both title and ID
- Caused a stale-looking detail page after marking a show's last watched episode unwatched - the unwatch succeeded and synced correctly to Plex/Emby/Jellyfin/Trakt, but the page's live in-place refresh failed to re-fetch the now-invisible show and kept showing the old watched state until a manual reload
- Shows now group and display correctly regardless of watched/unwatched state, rendering as "0 of N episodes watched" instead of vanishing; only genuinely untrustworthy library-scan rows are still excluded
- Documented the corrected behavior in docs/tv-shows.md
- Replaced the 20-cell Key Features table (paragraph-length cells, an empty header row causing extra whitespace at the top) with a scannable one-line-per-feature bullet list, linking to docs/architecture.md for depth
- Condensed the densest prose sections (Sync safety, webhook setup, Trakt import/sync, setup guide) to their essential points, moving implementation detail into the existing docs/ pages instead of duplicating it in the README
- Removed the emoji used on every section heading and nav link throughout the file
- Trimmed the file from 512 to under 400 lines while keeping every setup instruction and reference table intact
- Fixed a regression from the earlier fully-unwatched-show visibility fix: unwatching an episode inserts a fresh row timestamped now, and that was being read as the show's most recent watch, bumping it to the top of Watched Newest and inflating its displayed watched-episode count
- Fixed a serious identity bug: a show's TVDB id was being read from any tracked episode row, but Plex/Emby/Jellyfin webhooks tag episodes with their own TVDB id, not the show's - using that id for TVDB series routing could load a completely unrelated show and sync watch state to it. A show's TVDB id is now only trusted once it has actually been resolved as a real series (search result, Fix Match, or a prior correct visit), never from a raw, unverified episode id
- Season and show progress labels now show Removing... while an unwatch is in flight, instead of a stale watched count until the page finishes re-rendering
- Added a regression test covering the TVDB identity fix
- Detail-page Force Sync -> Import Watched Status was silently dropping any episode a server flagged as played but returned no watched timestamp for - common when episodes are bulk-marked watched through a server's own library UI rather than played through
- Those episodes now import using the episode's own release date instead of being skipped, since this action is explicit and scoped to one title (unlike the automatic background sync, which still requires a real watched date to avoid manufacturing phantom watches across an entire library)
- An episode with neither a watched date nor a release date is still skipped rather than given a fabricated date
- Added regression tests for both the fallback and the still-skip case
- A title lookup with no provider id to disambiguate by (queryShowDetail without an id) picked whichever matching cluster was most recently touched, with no regard for how much real history backed it
- One bad Trakt import row resolving an ambiguous title to a completely unrelated show could outrank dozens of correctly identified episodes just by being newer, sending the whole show's page, Force Sync, and Fix Match to the wrong identity
- Title lookups now prefer the substantially larger, established cluster over a much smaller one even when the smaller one is more recent; comparably-sized clusters still resolve by recency as before
- Added a regression test and documented the tie-break in docs/tv-shows.md
- After using Fix Match to repair a show's identity, the detail page briefly rendered 0 watched episodes even though the underlying data was already correct - the client's lookup for the show's cached full episode list only matched by tmdb_id or an exact title-slug match, both of which can miss right after a rematch (tmdb_id is cleared and re-backfilled in the background; the display title can legitimately drop a trailing year the provider's own name still carries)
- The lookup now also matches by tvdb_id when the provider supplied one, so a repaired show renders its real watched state immediately instead of falling back to an empty placeholder
- Documented the matching order in docs/tv-shows.md
- Force Sync -> Import Watched Status decided whether to insert a watched record by checking findWatchedByAnyMediaKey (does any watched row exist anywhere in history), not the episode's actual current state
- A later unwatch always wins the display's dedup tie-break by recency, so an old watched row can sit dormant on file while the show still displays and counts as unwatched - the old check treated that dormant row as proof there was nothing to do and silently skipped it
- Now checks the actual canonical pointer (getCanonicalWatchState) instead, so a source confirming an episode is still watched inserts a fresh record and genuinely restores the correct watched state
- Added a regression test documenting the exact gap between the two checks
- Documented the fix in docs/media-detail.md
- getCanonicalWatchState matches by provider id/media_key, but an incoming Plex/Emby/Jellyfin item's ids are episode-scoped (its own imdb/tvdb id, not the show's) and often don't match the playstate row's identity - the lookup fell through to the same any-watched-row check the previous fix was meant to replace, still finding a dormant old watched row and wrongly reporting nothing to do
- A show-scoped pull now builds a season+episode -> sync_action map once from the show's own current detail and checks that first - the exact data the display itself groups from, so it can't disagree with what the page renders
- Verified against live production logs: outbound dispatch to Plex/Emby/Jellyfin was already succeeding for every episode, confirming the sync engine and webhook echo protection were healthy - only the local re-import decision was wrong
- remoteItemToMedia only fell back to the show's requested tmdb/tvdb ids when the source item provided none at all - but Plex/Emby/Jellyfin always tag an episode with its own tmdb/tvdb id (both providers assign episodes ids separate from their series), so that fallback never triggered
- Every episode Import Watched Status inserted was tagged with its own episode-level identity instead of the show's, fragmenting it into its own show cluster and reproducing the exact display bug the previous two fixes were meant to resolve
- An episode's tmdb_id/tvdb_id now always come from the show actually being pulled; imdb_id still comes from the item, since it is meaningfully episode-scoped and does not affect show grouping
- Verified live: confirmed via production logs and direct API checks that this is what was actually happening, then added a regression test
- queryShowDetail and rematchShowWatchRecords (Fix Match) both did an exact show_title_lower match first, only falling back to a broader canonical scan when that found zero rows - never when it found an incomplete subset
- The same real show's episode rows can carry different exact show_title text over time (a media server's own title is rarely year-suffixed even when Plembfin's preferred display title is), so an exact match silently saw only one variant and missed the rest of the show's episodes - or resolved a different variant to an unrelated show sharing that exact text
- This is what was actually blocking School Spirits Season 3 after every earlier fix: a Fix Match run only repaired the rows matching its anchor's exact title text, leaving Season 3's rows on their old identity untouched
- Both functions now always scan by the same normalized canonical key (title with any trailing year stripped) that episodes are grouped by everywhere else, so a lookup or repair can no longer see only part of a show
- Added a regression test with episodes split across a year-suffixed and non-year-suffixed title for the same show
- Fixed a stuck 6/6 Available badge on shows opened via a tmdb/tvdb detail link: the Seerr background-refresh repaint only checked the plain /tvshow/:key slug, which those routes never set, so a completed correct fetch never re-rendered the page
- Availability pills now show the actual resolution found on the connected server instead of a hardcoded 1080p; a TV season only claims a resolution when every available episode in it shares one, otherwise it drops the claim rather than guessing
- Movies now get a real resolution reading too, pulled the same way TV episodes get theirs
- Fixed the Edit Watch Date dialog under-reporting an episode's play count when its watch rows had differently formatted show titles (missing a trailing year on one row but not another), the same normalization bug already fixed for show lookups and Fix Match
- Added a regression test covering the watch-date dialog fix
- Live-verified the earlier show-title normalization fix on Trying S05E07 and found the dialog still under-counted: a real play whose sync_action was later flipped to unwatched (e.g. an explicit unwatch from a connected server) has a watched_at but no longer looks like a watched row, so it was silently excluded from the list even though the episode card's own N actual watches badge already counted it
- siblingWatchRowsFor() now trusts a sibling row the same way the show page's own history grouping does, instead of requiring its current action to be watched
- Added a regression test covering an episode with one watched play and one later-unwatched play
- Fix TV show detail page to correctly merge episode-level watch history records
- Scope show grouping union-find to show-level provider IDs so episode-level IDs do not partition series episodes
- Update documentation for show grouping and client-side history merging
- Prevent show modal DOM wipe on in-place re-renders and live updates
- Ensure all episode rows belonging to a series are merged into the main show record
- Use majority provider ID frequency across episode records to prevent stray row hijacking
- Fix Remove Duplicate TV Watches scan in Settings to accurately identify episodes with multiple recorded watch dates
- Normalize media type aliases like TV and show in duplicate watch scan and cleanup endpoints
- Keep the oldest watch date and remove subsequent duplicate plays during library-wide cleanup
- Marking an episode, season, show, or movie watched/unwatched no longer disables mark watched/unwatched buttons for unrelated episodes, seasons, shows, or movies while its sync to Plex/Emby/Jellyfin/Trakt is still running
- A large season or show sync only blocks further actions on the same episodes it's syncing, not the whole app - you can mark a different show or movie watched right away instead of waiting
- Show-wide controls (mark/resync the whole show, edit show date, edit images, fix match, merge) still wait for every in-flight action on that show to finish, since they would otherwise re-push episodes still mid-sync
- Documented the new scoped syncing behavior in docs/media-detail.md

## v0.9.7 - 21 August 2026

Fix - Scroll expanded seasons into view below the sticky topbar

- develop's displayed version no longer derives from alpha's or main's current version (${mainVersion}.${alphaBuild}.${developBuild}) - it is now a plain incrementing build counter shown as "Develop Build N"
- Fixes the sidebar/Settings-About version looking lower than its parent branch right after a promotion to alpha or main, since the borrowed version string only self-healed on develop's own next push and had no way to update itself when a promotion happened elsewhere
- The build counter never resets on a promotion (only the entry list is cleared), so it can never appear to regress relative to a branch it was promoted from
- Updated the pending-build comparison, changelog rendering, and the (previously unwired) promotion scripts to match; added test coverage for the new comparison logic
- promoteDevelopToAlpha() now zeroes develop's build counter (not just its entry list) when develop is promoted to alpha, so the next develop push after a promotion starts back at build 1
- This reset is safe because it happens as a deliberate, explicit step of the promotion itself, not an inferred comparison against a version string that could be stale - the same safe shape as alpha's own reset-on-promotion-to-main
- Documented the distinction in update-develop-changelog.js and docs/architecture.md
- Clicking a season header to expand it now scrolls that season into view, instead of leaving the newly-revealed episode list to open off-screen below where you clicked
- Collapsing a season still preserves the scroll position as before, so the page doesn't jump now that the content above has shrunk
- The season-scroll fix from the previous commit used scrollIntoView's default alignment, which puts the season header flush with the very top of the viewport - directly underneath the sticky page topbar, hiding it
- Now offsets the scroll target by the topbar's real rendered height so the expanded season lands visible just below it instead of overshooting and disappearing behind it
- Clicking a season header to expand it, or loading a URL that names a season directly, now scrolls that season into view instead of leaving it open off-screen below the click or hidden at the very top of the page
- Fixed the actual scroll target: this app's shell keeps window/document fixed and scrolls .page-shell internally, so the first attempt (window.scrollTo) silently did nothing - now walks up to whichever ancestor actually has the overflow
- Reserves space for the sticky topbar via scroll-margin-top so the season header lands visible just below it instead of hidden underneath
- Replaced the browser's native (non-configurable, abrupt) smooth scroll with a hand-rolled eased animation
- A season named in the URL scrolls into view once on that navigation, not on every later re-render of the same modal (e.g. toggling an episode watched)

## v0.9.6 - 21 August 2026

Fix - Stop same-event webhook echoes inflating play counts

- Suppress background dashboard and watch history reloads while any sync operation (Force Sync, Cron Sync, Full Sync, or background dispatch) is actively running
- Settle and refresh the dashboard cleanly once when the sync completes, stops, or fails
- Wire active sync progress checks into live history refresh throttling to avoid flickering and card reloading during large syncs
- Dashboard no longer refreshes repeatedly while a background sync is in progress after marking something watched in Plex
- Fixed a bug where the sync reconciliation pass treated a missing local watch record as an explicit "unwatched" decision, causing it to push real "mark unplayed" calls to Plex/Emby/Jellyfin for items that were genuinely watched but had no matching Plembfin history row (e.g. after phantom-watch repair deleted the row)
- The reconciliation pass now only treats an item as canonical-unwatched when Plembfin holds an explicit unwatched record; if there is no record at all, it leaves the media server's watched state alone instead of guessing
- Phantom-watch burst detection no longer flags a normal multi-hour, multi-show viewing session as an import-echo flood: cross-show bursts must now fit within a 10-minute span, not just have no single gap over 3 minutes
- Phantom-watch burst repair now skips any watch row that every other configured media server has already independently confirmed as synced, so a real, cross-verified watch is never deleted just because its timing happens to match a suspicious pattern
- Applied the same no-history-is-not-unwatched fix to the modern scoped Force Sync planner, which previously could still push a false mark-unplayed to Plex/Emby/Jellyfin for an item with no Plembfin history row
- Added updatedAfter/updatedBefore Force Sync scope filters, so a repair can be limited to items Plembfin touched in a specific time window rather than filtering by original watch date
- The backlog sync-retry queue now only re-sends mark-played to the specific targets still missing confirmation instead of all three every time, clearing large backlogs faster with less redundant traffic
- Fixed a playstate/watch_history drift: deleting a single history row (e.g. via the History page's delete button) now also cleans up the matching playstate row, so Plembfin's own watched indicator can no longer disagree with its own history after a record is removed
- Fixed the outbound-mark echo detector comparing raw title strings, which meant a source that formats an episode as "Show (2025) - S01E02" and another that reports it as "Show - S01E02" (only one carrying the year suffix) never shared a cache key
- Because of that mismatch, a media server's own echo of an outbound mark Plembfin just sent was not recognized as an echo, was treated as a brand-new watch, and created a duplicate watch_history row for an episode already recorded from another source
- The echo-loop cache key now uses the same canonicalized show/movie title matching already trusted elsewhere in the app for this exact year-suffix mismatch, instead of the raw, unnormalized title string
- Exported the existing canonicalShowTitleKey/showTitleFrom helpers from dataRepo.js for reuse in syncOrchestrator.js rather than duplicating the normalization logic
- Fixed replaceTrackerSnapshot failing with a UNIQUE constraint error whenever the combined Trakt snapshot list contained more than one entry for the same media_key (e.g. a rewatch Trakt reports as a separate play), which crashed the whole snapshot replace and made the Trakt watched-state poll fail on every subsequent tick
- The combined snapshot list is now deduplicated by media_key, keeping the most recently reported watched_at, before being written to tracker_item_state
- Fixed the per-minute scheduled-sync tick timing out at 50 seconds during a large outstanding backlog, even though the underlying work (unwatched-state checks, recently-watched/resumable polling across all three platforms, and manual-dispatch retries) was still succeeding in the background
- Promise.race does not cancel the underlying task on timeout, so the tight budget did not stop progress, it only produced a recurring false timeout error and delayed when that progress became visible through cache invalidation
- Raised the budget from 50 to 120 seconds; the existing scheduledTasksInFlight guard already prevents two runs from overlapping, so this is safe even if a pass occasionally runs past one tick
- Fixed rowToWatch never including updated_at (or created_at) on the objects returned by getCachedHistory(), which is what Force Sync's scoped plan reads
- The updatedAfter/updatedBefore scope filter added earlier today compared row.updated_at against the requested window, but that field was always undefined coming through this path, so every row was silently excluded and the scoped plan always reported zero actions regardless of real activity
- Added created_at and updated_at to rowToWatch's output so the scope filter can actually see them
- Fixed importTraktPlayHistory only checking for an existing local watch via an exact (media_key, watched_at) match, which misses an already-recorded episode whenever the Trakt entry's own media key differs from how the existing record was stored (e.g. a manual watch keyed by tmdb vs a Trakt entry keyed by imdb for the same episode)
- This became active once the earlier tracker-snapshot crash fix let the import step actually run again, and it was inserting a second watch_history row - dated whenever Trakt reported the play, often today - for episodes already recorded under a different key
- The import now also checks getCanonicalWatchState, the same coordinate/provider-id fallback matching every other ingest path in the app already relies on, before deciding an episode is new; a canonical "watched" answer skips the insert instead of creating a duplicate
- Cleaned up 31 duplicate rows this surfaced across multiple shows via the existing Dedup History tool
- Audited every code path that can insert a new watch_history row and found several still relying on an exact media_key match (or playstate alone) to decide whether an item is already watched, instead of the broader coordinate/provider-id fallback matching used elsewhere - this is the exact mismatch behind today's Silo, Trying, Lioness, and Cape Fear phantom watches
- Hardened the Plex real-time notification handler, the main webhook handler, the per-episode bulk webhook mark path, the shared watched-transition helper (used by Trakt polling and other manual/webhook paths), and the live-session tracker to all consistently check findWatchedByAnyMediaKey before logging a new watch
- A hit under a different key now repairs the local playstate pointer instead of inserting a duplicate row, closing this class of bug at every remaining ingest path rather than one incident at a time
- Stats page now collapses duplicate rows created when a media server fires its played webhook multiple times for one viewing, matching the logic already used by the movie list and Dedup History tool
- Fixes titles showing an inflated most-watched count (e.g. a movie showing 3 plays for a single viewing) even though the dedup tool correctly reports nothing to clean up
- No watch_history rows are changed; this only affects how Stats counts them

- Fix: Stop non-release commits from polluting changelog entries

## v0.8.6 - 20 August 2026

Fix - Stop a stale historyId from swapping in the wrong show's page

- Trakt's /sync/history and /sync/history/remove both return 200 OK with a body summarizing what actually matched (added/deleted counts, not_found lists) even when nothing did - dispatchTrakt never read that body, so a canonical replay's clear-existing-plays step could silently fail to match anything on Trakt's side while telemetry still reported a clean success
- Reproduced live: re-ran Force Sync's Set Plembfin as Source of Truth for G'wed and every episode logged Trakt success, but all 8 previously-duplicated episodes were still sitting under their old date on trakt.tv afterward
- dispatchTrakt now inspects the response: a non-empty not_found on the add step is reported as an error instead of a false success, and a canonical replay's clear step reports how many plays it actually deleted and how many it could not recognize
- This makes the failure visible in telemetry going forward rather than fixing it silently - the underlying reason Trakt doesn't recognize these specific episodes for removal still needs the not_found detail from a real run to diagnose
- Trakt sync for episodes no longer replaces an episode's own stored provider ids with a TMDB title-search result; existing ids now always win, and the lookup is skipped entirely once an episode already has one
- Root cause of persistent duplicate/stuck Trakt entries for shows with short or ambiguous titles (e.g. G'wed): TMDB's search resolved to the wrong series, and that wrong id silently replaced the correct one on every dispatch, making Trakt unable to match the item to clear or add plays
- Trakt dispatch now reports a real error (with the not_found detail) instead of a false success when Trakt cannot recognize the item
- Settings -> Tools -> Database Repairs now has a Remove Duplicate Watches tool with separate confirmed actions for TV shows and movies
- Scans the whole library, keeps only the oldest watch date for each episode or movie, and shows the exact number of duplicate watches and affected items before asking for confirmation - the deletion cannot be undone once approved
- Removed watches are pushed out as corrected canonical state to every connected platform (Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, Trakt), the same propagation already used by the per-season duplicate cleanup and manual watch-date edits
- New GET /api/duplicate-watch-scan and POST /api/duplicate-watch-cleanup endpoints, both admin-only
- Marking a season or whole show watched at once no longer stamps every episode with the identical watched_at; each episode is now staggered one second apart in episode order so they sort correctly instead of tying
- Added a new watched-date choice, Same as other episodes, shown whenever an episode in the same season (or show) already has a recorded watch date - it reuses that episode's date/time as the base for the rest, with the same ordering applied on top
- Fixed a real incident: a burst of Trakt API calls (from marking a season watched) caused Trakt's watched-progress response to come back rate-limited and incomplete, and the live Trakt sync trusted the shorter list as a genuine unwatch - cascading unwatched state to Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, and Plembfin's own history across three seasons of a show
- Live Trakt sync now holds back any unwatch where a large share of one show's episodes disappear at once instead of propagating immediately; it re-checks on the next poll and only propagates once the same episodes are still missing a second time, so a genuine unwatch still goes through with a one-minute delay while a transient bad response self-heals with no changes sent anywhere
- A normal unwatch of a couple of episodes is unaffected and still propagates the same minute as before
- Marking a season or show watched at once (and bulk unwatch) now dispatches to Plex/Emby/Jellyfin/Trakt with bounded concurrency instead of one item at a time, so large batches finish noticeably faster without increasing load on any single server (outbound requests are still throttled per-host)
- Fixed a real incident: marking The 'Burbs S01E05 watched appeared to succeed, then silently reverted seconds later - Trakt's API hadn't caught up to the write yet, so the next poll saw the episode as missing and treated it as a genuine remote unwatch, deleting the watch it had just created and re-propagating the unwatch to Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin
- Live Trakt sync now protects a single item just marked watched the same way it already protects large batches: a poll landing within 30 minutes of that push can no longer read a lagging snapshot as a real unwatch
- The sidebar Syncing N of M indicator now shows the true batch total immediately for a Trakt reconcile or bulk mark-watched/unwatched, instead of climbing one item at a time as workers pick up new items over the life of the batch
- Fixed a real incident: marking The 'Burbs S01E05 watched via Same as other episodes kept reporting success and syncing to Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, and Trakt, but the watched state never actually saved and reverted on reload
- Root cause: an earlier unwatch had left a non-watched bookkeeping row at the exact same media identity and timestamp the mark-watched request targeted; the duplicate check only looked at whether a row existed there at all, not whether it was actually marked watched, so it silently skipped writing the new watched state while still dispatching outbound sync as if it had
- Manual mark-watched and marking watched from Part Watched now replace that kind of stale row with the real watched record instead of mistaking it for an existing watch
- Removed a large empty gap that showed in the Force Sync dialog before starting an operation - the dialog now sizes to its content and only grows once the live log is actually showing
- Fixed the live sync log growing past the bottom of the dialog during a run; it now fills the remaining space and scrolls on its own instead of pushing the whole dialog past its own edge
- Added season checkboxes to the Force Sync dialog for TV shows - leave them unchecked to run across the whole show as before, or pick specific seasons to limit Set Plembfin as Source of Truth or Import Watched Status to just those
- Fixed a real bug: clicking a global search result for a TV show could open a completely different show's page instead - the URL still showed the show you clicked, but the title, poster, and episodes shown were whatever show had been open right before
- Root cause: navigating to a show via a link that doesn't carry its own historyId (search results, unlike library cards) inherited the previous show's leftover historyId from app state, and the page then mistakenly treated that mismatched record as evidence the requested show couldn't be identified, substituting the unrelated show's single record in its place
- The router now only carries a historyId forward when re-rendering the show already open, never into a navigation to a different show
- A history record that names a real, different show is now treated as a stale reference and ignored, rather than swapped in as if the requested show were unidentifiable

## v0.8.5 - 19 August 2026

Fix - Track sync progress at the shared dispatch functions, not just the retry queue

- Added a bridge/hub framing to the README intro: Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, Trakt, Seerr, and the metadata providers never talk to each other directly, only through Plembfin
- Added a new section with a diagram showing Plembfin as the central node and its local SQLite store as the canonical memory
- No behavior changes; documentation only
- Trimmed the intro and hub diagram to a single simple flowchart with icon-led bullets instead of dense paragraphs
- Replaced the plain-text hub diagram with the actual Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin logos plus brand-colored badges for Trakt, TMDB, TheTVDB, Fanart.tv, OMDb, and Overseerr/Jellyseerr
- Removed the dark circle backdrops behind every node in the hub diagram
- Added real TheTVDB and Overseerr/Jellyseerr logos (sourced from the walkxcode/dashboard-icons project) in place of placeholder monogram circles
- Re-trimmed every connector line so arrowheads land visibly at each icon's edge instead of hiding under a circle
- Fanart.tv and OMDb have no available vector logo, so they render as plain colored text instead of a fake or placeholder icon
- Removing a watch date (single row or the season bulk cleanup) now also removes any webhook-echoed duplicate row chained to it within the same 10-minute event window, instead of deleting only the row you clicked
- Fixes manual watch history removal working inconsistently: items with an echoed duplicate row would have the deleted watch date silently reappear as a new entry the next time the list was rebuilt
- Added regression tests covering echo-chain deletion and confirming genuine rewatches outside the event window are left untouched
- Documented the echo-chain handling for both the single-row and season bulk delete paths in docs/media-detail.md
- Removing a watch date from the single-item Edit Watch Date dialog now clears the cached dashboard/explorer history and forces a refetch, instead of only patching the deleted row's watched_at in memory
- Fixes the dashboard showing a stale rewatch count (e.g. still '4 actual watches' after a delete) until some unrelated reload happened to refresh it
- Brings the single-row delete path in line with the season bulk 'Remove duplicate watches' cleanup and 'Mark unwatched', which already refresh history after deleting
- Documented the cache refresh in docs/media-detail.md
- The forced dashboard history refresh (used right after deleting a watch date, marking watched/unwatched, etc) fetched with cache: no-store, which bypasses the browser's HTTP cache on read but never updates it either
- Every dashboard-view entry runs a second, unforced history fetch right after (cache: default, reusing the endpoint's 30s max-age), which could still return the original pre-edit response left over from the page's first load and silently overwrite the just-refreshed data
- Reproduced live: deleting watch dates on a movie correctly updated the backend and the detail page immediately, but the dashboard card briefly reverted to the pre-edit watch count and date after navigating back to it
- Switched the forced fetch to cache: reload, which still forces a real network round trip but also refreshes the HTTP cache entry, so the follow-up unforced fetch no longer serves stale data
- Deleting a watch date (single row, or the season 'Remove duplicate watches' bulk cleanup) now replays the resulting canonical state to every connected Plex/Emby/Jellyfin/Trakt server - the rolled-back date if a watch remains, or unwatched if that was the last one
- Reuses the same loop-safe canonical replay (syncCanonicalPlaystate) that editing a watch date and Force Sync's 'Set Plembfin as Source of Truth' already use, so a corrected server does not turn around and echo the old state back in as a new phantom watch
- Previously a deleted watch date only removed the local Plembfin row; any platform it had already been dispatched to as watched kept believing that, and its own next catch-up scan could reintroduce it as a brand-new watch
- deleteWatchDate/deleteWatchDates now report the surviving and deleted rows so the route layer can decide which state to replay; added regression tests for the new return values
- The scheduled Plex/Emby/Jellyfin catch-up sync's 'already watched?' check failed to recognize a movie it already had a record for when the title differed only by whitespace variant (Trakt imports often carry a non-breaking space after a colon where media servers report a plain space), so the same movie could get imported a second time under a title-only identity instead of being recognized as already watched
- findWatchedByAnyMediaKey now falls back to the same whitespace-normalizing canonicalTitleKey comparison already trusted elsewhere in the app to merge these rows for display, so this can no longer create a duplicate watch for any movie going forward
- Fix Match (PATCH /api/update-watch) previously updated a row's provider ids without ever recomputing its media_key, so a correction left the row permanently split from any other watch of the same item under its old identity; it now accepts imdb_id as well as tmdb_id/tvdb_id, recomputes media_key when identity changes, and merges playstate on both the old and new key
- Documented both fixes in docs/scheduled-sync.md and docs/media-detail.md; added regression tests for the media_key migration and playstate merge
- The sidebar now shows a live "Syncing N of M" indicator above the version number whenever the scheduler's pending-dispatch queue is working through a backlog, and hides once it drains
- The pending-dispatch queue (syncPendingManualDispatches) now reports its backlog size and progress to runtime_state each tick; the existing live-updates SSE stream polls it once a second and pushes sync-progress events to the browser, so the indicator updates in real time without polling from the client
- Dashboard watch-history cards now show a separate "Watched Twice" (or "Watched N Times") line instead of appending "· N actual watches" onto the Last Played date
- Documented both in docs/dashboard.md and docs/scheduled-sync.md
- The sidebar's sync-progress indicator only tracked the scheduler's per-minute pending-dispatch queue, so it stayed hidden for anything that dispatches immediately instead - a bulk duplicate-watch cleanup, a single manual watch/unwatch, a webhook-triggered propagation - which is most of what actually generates background sync activity
- Moved the tracking into syncMediaPlaystate and syncMediaUnplayedPlaystate in syncOrchestrator.js, the shared functions every dispatch path funnels through, so the indicator now covers all of them without depending on knowing every call site
- A dispatch burst opens on the first call after being idle and closes 2 seconds after the last one in it finishes, so a handful of near-simultaneous fire-and-forget calls (one per affected episode from a season cleanup, for example) share one window instead of flickering
- Removed the now-redundant tracking that lived directly in the retry queue, since it already goes through the same shared functions

## v0.8.4 - 19 August 2026

Fix - Prevent phantom local watches from echoed Trakt play-history imports

- Edit Season Date now shows a Remove Duplicate Watches option when any episode in the season has more than one recorded watch, keeping only the oldest date per episode and deleting the rest in a single confirmed action instead of removing them one at a time
- New POST /api/delete-watch-dates endpoint bulk-deletes watch records and rolls each affected show/episode's canonical watched state back to whichever watch survives, in one request instead of one per row
- The show-level Edit Date control (top action bar) now shows one row per season instead of forcing the whole show onto a single date/time - each season defaults to its own latest watched date and can be changed independently before saving
- Settings -> Changelog now lists the actual changes in a newer, not-yet-pulled alpha build under a new "Not pulled yet" section, instead of only saying a newer build exists and requiring an update first to see what changed
- The backend was already fetching the newer build's changelog data to detect an update, but discarded the entry list and kept only the build number; it now reads GitHub's copy of the changelog directly, since a build that hasn't been pulled yet can never appear in the locally-installed copy
- Extracted the comparison logic into a pure, unit-tested function
- Marking an episode or movie watched with a specific date (e.g. release date) via the Mark Watched action reached Trakt stamped as watched right now instead of the date chosen in Plembfin, because the media object built for outbound dispatch never carried a watched_at field
- Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin were never affected since their mark-played APIs don't accept a historical date at all; the Edit Date correction path was also unaffected since it built its dispatch payload differently
- Added regression tests covering both the dispatch payload and Trakt's client sending the supplied date verbatim
- Trakt play-history import now recognizes a play that arrives shortly after Plembfin's own outbound watched push as an echo of that push, not a new play, and skips creating a duplicate local watch for it
- Fixes a defense-in-depth gap: the echo check reads outbound state captured before the snapshot rewrite that runs earlier in the same poll, so a just-pushed item that hasn't shown up in Trakt's watched snapshot yet no longer loses its echo marker
- Documented the new guard in docs/scheduled-sync.md

## v0.8.3 - 19 August 2026

Performance - Process Force Sync episodes concurrently; UI polish on watch-date and danger buttons

- Trakt's live sync now imports every play from a connected account's watch history, not just the most recent one, so rewatches show up individually in History and Stats instead of being collapsed into a single watched record
- The first poll after connecting backfills the full Trakt play history; later polls only fetch plays since the last import, tracked per Trakt history id so nothing is imported twice
- Backfilled rewatches update Plembfin's local history and refresh the last-watched timestamp shown elsewhere in the app, without re-sending duplicate mark-watched calls to connected Plex/Emby/Jellyfin servers
- Pushing local watches to Trakt already sent each play individually and is unchanged
- Documented the new behavior in docs/scheduled-sync.md, docs/sqlite-schema.md, and the README's Trakt sections
- The Trakt play-history import added earlier today did not mark its backfilled watch records as already synced, so the scheduler's manual-dispatch retry sweep treated them as pending work and re-sent them to every connected service, including pushing them back out to Trakt
- Each outbound push created a brand new Trakt history entry, which the next poll then re-imported as a fresh play and pushed again, looping every minute for the whole Trakt history and flooding the account's watch history page
- Backfilled plays are now stored with telemetry marking them fully settled, so the retry sweep skips them and they are never re-propagated to Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, or Trakt
- Broadened the outbound Trakt echo guard to skip any Trakt-sourced record (live sync or import), not just an exact source match, closing the same gap for the existing CSV/JSON Trakt import feature too
- Removes the detail-page and library-wide Force Sync "Full Sync" option, which silently reconciled server state with Plembfin and could insert duplicate, today-dated watch records when a show's metadata was rematched on a media server
- Renames "Push To" to "Set Plembfin as Source of Truth" and "Pull From" to "Import Watched Status", with descriptions that state plainly what each one does and does not do (Push overwrites destinations without checking them first; Import only adds, never sends anything out or removes anything)
- Fixes episode watch/playstate lookups to recognize an episode as already recorded even after a media-server metadata rematch changes its provider ids or its show title gains or loses a trailing year (e.g. "Ludwig" vs "Ludwig (2024)"), preventing duplicate watch history entries in that situation
- Adds a one-time repair (GET /api/stale-trakt-import-audit, POST /api/stale-trakt-import-repair) for watch records left behind by the Trakt rewatch-import incident, which were still being repeatedly re-sent to Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, and Trakt by the retry queue
- Set Plembfin as Source of Truth and Import Watched Status now process several episodes at once instead of one at a time, so shows with many seasons sync significantly faster; both operations still confirm before starting and support cancellation mid-run
- Outbound calls to Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin remain safely throttled per server regardless of how many episodes are in flight, since the existing outbound governor limits concurrency per host independently of this change
- Removing a watch date now shows "Removing..." while the request is in flight instead of the row silently freezing with no feedback
- The remove-watch-date button and all danger-styled buttons (including Force Sync's Cancel operation) now use the site's standard rounded corners instead of a mix of a full circle and no rounding at all

## v0.8.2 - 18 August 2026

Fix - Stop CI plumbing commits from polluting release changelog entries

- The main and alpha changelog generators no longer pull bullet points from the bot's own chore: bump alpha build for / chore: update changelog for commits, or from Merge branch/commit/pull request commits - these carry no user-visible content and were showing up as literal bullets in published release notes
- When the commit that triggers a changelog entry is itself one of those plumbing commits (routine for a Merge alpha with main force-push, since GitHub reports the pushed range's last commit as the trigger), the entry's headline now falls back to the most recent real commit instead of showing a meaningless title like "Chore - Bump alpha build for <sha>"
- Manually corrected the already-published 0.8.1 changelog entry, which combined a full day's worth of iterative alpha commits (including several that were later throttled, disabled, and re-enabled again) into a single overwhelming and self-contradicting list; consolidated it down to the net, final user-facing changes
- Added test coverage for the new noise-detection helper

## v0.8.1 - 18 August 2026

Fix - Re-enable Emby/Jellyfin unwatched-reconciliation polling by default

- Fixed the real-time Plex notification listener silently ignoring "Mark Unwatched" changes when Plex left a stale resume position behind instead of clearing it, which previously left Emby and Jellyfin showing the item as partially watched indefinitely
- Force Sync no longer records a fake "just watched" date for a title whose played flag has no reliable timestamp on Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin - it is skipped instead of imported with a fabricated date
- Unwatching a title now clears its resume/continue-watching position on every connected server, not just the played flag, so a title doesn't keep showing as partially watched after being unwatched
- Editing, adding, or bulk-editing a watched date on a media detail page now pushes the corrected date to Trakt and every connected Plex/Emby/Jellyfin server in the background
- Trakt watched-date corrections no longer create a duplicate history entry every time they run - a correction now replaces the existing entry instead of stacking a new one alongside it
- Emby and Jellyfin now have the same unwatch-reconciliation safety net Plex already had, catching a missed or misconfigured webhook; it checks a small batch sequentially every 5 minutes per platform so it can't compete with the scheduler for time
- Fixed the Settings -> Logs page showing identical content on every category tab
- Fixed a performance bug where rebuilding the TV show cache could block the server for over a second in one unbroken burst under load, severe enough to fail health checks and trigger repeated restarts - the rebuild now yields periodically instead
- Capped the Plex real-time notification listener at 3 concurrent handlers so a burst of notifications (e.g. right as it reconnects) can't spike memory by running hundreds of handlers at once
- Alpha builds now show their own version number (e.g. v0.8.0.7 alpha) in the sidebar and Settings -> About, with a real "Update available" indicator when a newer alpha build is published, and their own build history section separate from tagged releases
- The published alpha Docker image is now also tagged with its specific build number (alpha-<N>), alongside the existing rolling alpha tag
- Fixed a changelog-generator bug that could scramble a merged multi-commit release's notes into unreadable text

## v0.8.0 - 18 August 2026

Fix - Sync the pre-push hook by merge, not rebase

- Every push to the alpha branch now builds, verifies, and publishes ghcr.io/lasikiewicz/plembfin:alpha, so a pre-release image is always available to pull without waiting for a main release
- The alpha image goes through the same better-sqlite3/sharp native-module check as the main release image before it is pushed
- docker-build-check.yml goes back to pull-request-only verification, since alpha pushes now get the equivalent check as part of publishing
- Documented the new :alpha image in CLAUDE.md, docs/development.md, and the README
- The alpha image publish step used github.repository directly for the image name, which preserves the account's original casing (Lasikiewicz/plembfin) and GHCR rejected as an invalid tag; it now goes through docker/metadata-action like the main release pipeline does, which lowercases the ref before building
- The sidebar version badge and Settings -> About now show "alpha" next to the version number when running the ghcr.io/lasikiewicz/plembfin:alpha image, so a pre-release build is visually distinct from a tagged release
- The alpha image now bakes in a BUILD_CHANNEL=alpha flag at build time; the main/latest release image is unaffected and shows the plain version number as before
- Update-available checks and changelog entry matching still compare the underlying plain version number, so the alpha label is purely cosmetic
- The sidebar badge and Settings -> About no longer show "Update available" on the alpha channel; alpha's version number only advances when it is merged into a release, so it always trails main's latest version right after a merge even when the running alpha build already contains newer commits
- Settings -> About now shows a neutral "Alpha channel" banner instead, noting how many releases have landed on main since this build for context
- chore: bump version to 0.8.0
- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main' into alpha
- The pre-push hook always synced against a remote branch matching the currently checked-out branch name, regardless of the actual push target
- A force-push like alpha:main (used by the Merge alpha with main command) triggered a rebase of local alpha against origin/alpha instead of the real target, and since alpha's history contains a genuine merge commit, git silently flattened it and replayed its commits individually, conflicting with content the merge had already resolved
- The hook now only auto-syncs when the local and remote branch names in the push actually match, so a deliberately reconciled cross-ref push goes through untouched
- The previous fix stopped the hook from rebasing against the wrong branch on a cross-ref push, but git rebase still flattens merge commits regardless of which branch it targets: it walks full ancestry rather than just the first-parent chain, so it silently drops merge commits and replays both sides' commits individually
- The hook's same-name sync now runs git pull --no-rebase, which is a no-op when upstream is already an ancestor and a plain merge commit otherwise, matching the merge-based reconciliation CLAUDE.md already documents
- Updated CLAUDE.md, docs/architecture.md, and docs/development.md to describe the merge-based sync

## v0.7.11 - 18 August 2026

Chore - Switch to an alpha/main branching model for pushes and releases

- Day-to-day pushes now land on a new alpha branch instead of main; alpha gets the same secret-scan, security, and Docker build-check coverage main gets, so problems surface immediately without publishing a release
- main only moves through an explicit merge-alpha-with-main step, which force-pushes alpha onto main and lets CI combine every queued commit's changelog bullets into one release entry
- Updated the pre-push hook to sync against whichever branch is being pushed instead of always rebasing onto main
- Documented the new branching model and both agent commands in CLAUDE.md, docs/development.md, and the README

## v0.7.10 - 18 August 2026

Fix - Remove flaky credential vault tampering test

- Items pushed to Trakt now record the real play date and time instead of the moment the sync request was sent, so Trakt history reflects when something was actually watched
- The tampering test always overwrote the last ciphertext character with a fixed value, so it silently passed without proving tampering on the rare run where the random ciphertext already ended in that character. It now guarantees the substitution changes the byte, so the check reliably catches tampering on every run.

## v0.7.9 - 17 August 2026

Feature - Add season- and show-level mark unwatched

- Added a season-level "Mark season unwatched" button and a show-level "Mark Unwatched" button on TV show detail pages, alongside the existing episode-level control
- Both bulk-clear every watched episode in that scope and push the unplayed state to Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin the same way the existing episode unwatch button does
- Manual unwatch requests now accept a batch of watch-history ids (up to 100) in one call instead of only a single id at a time

## v0.7.8 - 17 August 2026

Fix - Clear progress button not removing part-watched items

- Clicking Clear Progress on a part-watched item whose canonical state was already unwatched (e.g. a re-watch in progress after an earlier unwatch) reported success but left the item stuck in the Part Watched list
- The playback progress row is now always deleted, so the item is correctly removed

## v0.7.7 - 17 August 2026

Fix - Preserve unwatched state on library additions

- Prevent delayed Emby and Jellyfin item-added events from restoring older watched history after a newer unwatch.
- Keep the current canonical Plembfin state authoritative when newly added media is caught up.
- Document the precedence rule and cover the Plex-to-media-server sequence with a regression test.

## v0.7.6 - 17 August 2026

Fix - Sync bulk Plex unwatched changes

- Resolve series provider IDs before sending episode watch changes to Trakt
- Make Sync Now repair unchanged Trakt watches that drifted across connected services
- Rebuild stale show-progress caches and document the reconciliation behavior

## v0.7.3 - 17 August 2026

Fix - Auto-close mobile navigation menu on item click

- Automatically close the mobile navigation drawer when selecting any Settings sub-section
- Dismiss the mobile navigation drawer upon central page navigation, search result selection, brand logo, and sign out clicks
- Add Escape key shortcut to close open mobile navigation menu
- Clean up and organize Trakt connection settings and documentation

## v0.7.2 - 16 August 2026

Fix - Restore Plex account connection

- New Plex connections use strong PIN authorization bound to Plembfin's encrypted device identity.
- Plex authorization returns refreshable account tokens without exposing the private device key.
- In-progress legacy connection attempts remain compatible during upgrades.

## v0.7.1 - 16 August 2026

Fix - Keep account authorization polling below rate limits

- Prevent Plex and Jellyfin authorization status polling from exhausting the account-action allowance.
- Keep start, login, disconnect, and other provider mutations protected by a dedicated rate limit.
- Document 429 recovery and the separate polling and mutation limits for live deployments.

## v0.7.0 - 16 August 2026

Feature - Unify account and tracker watch-state sync

- Connect Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin through verified account flows while keeping one optional manual credential mode per server.

- Refresh open Plembfin pages automatically as imported watch-state changes are processed.
- Encrypt provider tokens at rest and document the credential-key requirements for backup recovery.
- Improve Plex token recovery and user-scoped Emby and Jellyfin matching for reliable propagation.
- Add split web and worker coordination through shared SQLite state and an elected scheduler lease.
- Release the combined connection and synchronization upgrade as version 0.7.0.

## v0.6.79 - 6 August 2026

Fix - Expand people results in search

- Search people through TMDB's dedicated people catalogue instead of mixed results
- Add paginated loading for the full people result set
- Keep search panels bounded with independent scrolling and compact artwork

## v0.6.59 - 31 July 2026

Fix - Remove exact duplicate watch events

- Clean exact same-item same-timestamp echoes without deleting legitimate rewatches.

## v0.6.58 - 31 July 2026

Fix - Repair phantom watch batches safely

- Add a guarded repair for impossible Plex watch batches while preserving manual marks and genuine rewatches.

## v0.6.57 - 31 July 2026

Fix - Suppress outbound watch-state echoes

- Remember direct bulk and force-sync played marks so Plex does not re-import them as new viewing history.

## v0.6.56 - 31 July 2026

Fix - Align duplicate history cleanup

- Clean up cross-provider episode echoes even when media keys or sync fields differ, while preserving genuine movie rewatches.

## v0.6.55 - 31 July 2026

- Backfill missing IMDb/TMDB/TVDB provider IDs and canonical keys on title-fallback watch history records
- Collapse same-event duplicate watch entries across title-fallback and ID-bearing records
- Update history maintenance deduplication tool to execute provider ID resolution prior to same-event window clustering

## v0.6.54 - 29 July 2026

Fix - Rank search suggestions by relevance and tidy the results page layout

- Topbar search suggestions are now ranked by how closely each title matches what you typed, so the best match appears first whichever catalogue it came from
- A close match from TheTVDB is no longer pushed out of the suggestions by loosely matching TMDB results
- Titles already in your library win ties against the same title from a remote catalogue
- Search results columns no longer stretch to the full window height, so a single result sits in a panel sized to fit rather than a large empty box
- Search results columns now follow the light and dark themes instead of always painting a dark grey panel

## v0.6.53 - 29 July 2026

Feature - Search TheTVDB alongside TMDB instead of only as a fallback

- TheTVDB is now searched at the same time as TMDB, so series TMDB does not list appear as quickly as any other result rather than only when TMDB comes back empty
- Results from your library, TMDB and TheTVDB are merged on a normalised title, so a title punctuated differently by each source no longer appears twice
- The topbar search now works without a TMDB key configured, and a TMDB outage no longer hides local or TheTVDB results
- Cache TheTVDB search results so searching as you type stays fast and stays within the shared TheTVDB key's limits
- Load every frontend module from a single versioned URL, so the browser no longer loads the same module twice

## v0.6.52 - 29 July 2026

Feature - Find shows TMDB does not list, and install to a phone Home Screen

- Search now falls back to TheTVDB when TMDB lists no matching series, so shows TMDB has never catalogued are findable instead of returning nothing
- TVDB-only series open a full detail page with seasons, episodes and artwork, reached at /tvshow/tvdb/<id>
- The TVDB fallback only runs when TMDB has no plausible match, so searches TMDB already answers are unaffected and stay just as fast
- Add an Android/Chrome web manifest so Plembfin installs to a Home Screen standalone with the Plembfin icon
- Flatten the install icons onto the dark background colour, since both iOS and Android render transparent icon areas as black

## v0.6.51 - 29 July 2026

Fix - Use the Plembfin logo when adding the app to an iOS Home Screen

- Add a dedicated 180x180 Home Screen icon so iOS shows the Plembfin logo instead of a screenshot of the page
- Flatten the logo onto the dark background colour, since iOS renders transparent icon areas as black
- Label the Home Screen shortcut "Plembfin" rather than the full page title

## v0.6.50 - 29 July 2026

Chore - Use the Plembfin logo as the browser tab icon

- Browser tabs and bookmarks now show the Plembfin arrow logo instead of the generic placeholder mark
- Added the logo as a 512x512 transparent PNG so it stays crisp on high-DPI displays and in both light and dark browser themes
- Kept the existing placeholder art in place for missing posters and profile images, so card and cast fallbacks look unchanged

## v0.6.49 - 29 July 2026

Fix - Return to the correct library when leaving a movie or show page

- Leaving a TV show page returns to the TV Shows library instead of dropping you on Movies
- Closing a detail page updates the address bar, so the page title and the library controls (Hide Fully Watched, Hide Ended) come back with it
- The browser's own back and forward buttons restore the right title, back button, and control bar for the view they land on
- Opening a show from the poster grid no longer reloads the whole app, so it navigates as instantly as every other card
- Show posters stay real links, so middle-click, open in a new tab, and copy link address still work
- Detail pages opened straight from a URL or a bookmark return to the matching library instead of defaulting to Movies

## v0.6.48 - 28 July 2026

Feature - Add bio media layout toggle and layout refinements

- Add optional bio media layout toggle in appearance settings
- Refine poster, metadata sidebar, and watch status positioning in bio media layout

## v0.6.47 - 28 July 2026

Security - Reject unknown artwork variants instead of dispatching on them

- The artwork endpoint now resolves its handler from a fixed set of variants, so a request naming an unexpected variant is refused as a bad request rather than reaching an unintended function and failing as a server error
- Clears the open high-severity code-scanning alert for an unvalidated dynamic method call

## v0.6.46 - 28 July 2026

Chore - Build the Docker image on pull requests

- Pull requests now build the container image and start the database and image libraries inside it, so a change that breaks the container is caught before it can be released
- Closes the gap that let two versions publish with no usable image after the SQLite driver upgrade

## v0.6.45 - 28 July 2026

Fix - Repair the Docker image build after the SQLite driver upgrade

- Docker images build again: the new SQLite driver made npm try to compile the database module from source inside the image, which has no compiler, so no image was published for the last two releases
- The image now installs the prebuilt database binary that already ships for its platform, keeping the build fast and toolchain-free

## v0.6.44 - 28 July 2026

Fix - Stop retrying artwork the server cannot fetch

- Artwork from an unreachable image host is requested once per session instead of once per page render, clearing the repeated errors it left in the browser console
- A reload no longer re-requests artwork the server just reported as unavailable, while a recovered image host is picked back up within ten minutes
- The artwork picker hides images it cannot preview rather than offering a tile that fails to load, and preselects the first image that actually appeared
- Saving a logo that cannot be fetched leaves the title text in place instead of an empty image

## v0.6.43 - 28 July 2026

Chore - Bump better-sqlite3 from 12.11.1 to 13.0.1 (#20)

- [Release notes](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/releases)
- [Commits](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v8.7.0...v8.9.0)
- dependency-name: undici

## v0.6.41 - 28 July 2026

Fix - Faster media detail loading and reliable artwork

- TV show pages opened from a library card no longer sit on "Loading episode metadata...": a history-linked link now loads the full show instead of a single-record shell
- Show and movie pages request their metadata directly instead of queueing behind library prefetch, so a page refresh paints in a fraction of the time
- Show pages appear as soon as their own metadata arrives, with season episodes and the IMDb rating filling in afterwards
- Artwork from fanart.tv and TheTVDB is downloaded and cached by the server, so logos and the artwork picker keep working when those image hosts are unreachable from the browser
- Titles whose only TMDB logo art is in another language show their title text instead of a foreign wordmark
- Library grids show an animated placeholder while each poster loads instead of an empty tile

## v0.6.40 - 27 July 2026

Fix - Exclude episodes from show search results

- The global search TV Shows column now contains actual shows only, never individual episode history rows.

## v0.6.39 - 27 July 2026

Chore - Remove em and en dashes from the codebase and documentation

- Replaced every em dash and en dash with a plain hyphen across documentation, in-app help, UI copy, code comments, and configuration samples
- Settings help text, match report labels, and server log messages now read with hyphens instead of dashes
- Bundled changelog entries were rewritten the same way so the in-app Changelog matches

## v0.6.38 - 27 July 2026

Docs - List automatic catch-up of newly added media as a key feature

- Added "New media arrives watched" to the README feature table, next to bi-directional sync
- Noted that adding a whole show catches up its episodes and skips any the server already has as played
- Spelled out the library-add notification each server needs for it to work, with a link to the webhook guide

## v0.6.37 - 27 July 2026

Fix - Make newly added media actually get marked watched

- Library-add events from Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin were being discarded as invalid, so newly added media was never marked watched; they are now accepted and acted on
- Adding a show or a season now catches up its episodes, marking the ones you have already watched instead of only handling single items
- A newly added show can no longer be mistaken for the whole series being watched, which would have filed a watch for every episode
- Episodes a server already reports as played are left alone, and an episode with no watch record in Plembfin is never touched
- Webhook parsing tests now check that add events are treated as actionable, which is the gap that let this ship broken

## v0.6.36 - 27 July 2026

Feature - Mark newly added media watched and list only unidentified media in the match report

- Media that a server is simply missing is no longer listed in the Cross-Platform Match Report; the watch is recorded correctly and there was nothing to act on
- The report now lists only media Plembfin could not identify, which is the one case picking a title actually fixes
- When a media server announces newly added content you have already watched, it is now marked watched on that server as it arrives, instead of waiting for a Force Sync
- Catch-up only ever applies an existing watch to the server that added the item, and never creates watch history, so a library scan cannot invent a play
- Items with no watch record, items you marked unwatched, and platforms not set to receive watched state are left untouched
- Webhook setup help and docs now cover the library-add notification each server needs for this

## v0.6.35 - 27 July 2026

Fix - Keep manually matched media out of the match report queue

- A record you fix by picking the right title now leaves the manual matching queue instead of being offered again on every run
- The match report classifies rows by the provider IDs the record actually holds rather than by the key it was first stored under, which never changed when a match was applied later
- Report rows carry their IMDB, TMDB, and TVDB IDs so the Sync Issues panel can tell an unidentified item from one the library simply does not have

## v0.6.34 - 27 July 2026

Feature - Add match report rescan and separate unidentified media from library gaps

- Added a Rescan button to the Cross-Platform Match Report that re-runs the sync for every listed item and rebuilds the report, reporting how many now match
- Each report row now says which problem it is: media that was never identified, or media that is identified and simply missing from that library
- Fix All Matches now queues only the rows a title match can actually repair, instead of asking you to re-pick a title for media whose identity is already correct
- Items that are missing from a library are counted in the summary with what to do about them, rather than opening a search dialog that cannot help
- Report rows keep showing any sync detail the platform returned beyond the generic no-match message
- In-app Sync Issues help and the Settings documentation describe both failure kinds and what each button does

## v0.6.33 - 27 July 2026

Fix - Stop unwatch echo loop between media servers and repair Fix Match saves

- Fixed an unwatch feedback loop where Emby and Jellyfin echoed each other's unplayed events, deleting and re-creating the same watch record about once a second until it stopped on its own
- Echo detection now recognises a returning event as Plembfin's own write even when the media server reports provider IDs that the outgoing record did not carry
- Marking an item unwatched when it is already recorded as unwatched now changes nothing and propagates nothing, so a late echo cannot restart the cycle
- An unwatched record keeps the identity of the watched record it supersedes, so an open edit dialog or a queued manual match still points at a record that exists
- Fix Match in the Sync Issues manual match queue now saves instead of failing with "Watch record not found", and Retry Sync works on the same items
- Retry Sync and match saves send a media key alongside the record id and fall back to it when the id no longer resolves

## v0.6.32 - 27 July 2026

Fix - Repair manual match queue actions and keep both changelog sources visible

- Fix Match and Retry Sync now work from the Sync Issues manual match queue, which addresses records by media key instead of row id and previously failed with "Watch record not found"
- Saving a match against a media key writes the change instead of silently reporting success while leaving the record untouched
- Post-rematch artwork cleanup (poster cache reset, custom backdrop save, related artwork clearing) targets the correct record
- Settings > About merges the bundled release list with the published one, so a release present in only one of them still appears
- Update check re-reads GitHub at most once a minute, and an admin-forced refresh fetches immediately rather than waiting out a floor
- Update banner keys off the highest version known from either source
- Backup passphrase forms carry a hidden username field so password managers stop warning about them

## v0.6.31 - 27 July 2026

Fix - Deduplicate manual episode matching by show and reset telemetry on fix match

- Grouped manual match queue items by TV show so matching one episode fixes the entire show at once.
- Automatically filtered out redundant episode prompts for the same show after a show match is confirmed.
- Cleared stale error telemetry and reset sync retry backoffs in SQLite whenever provider IDs are updated via Fix Match.
- Invalidated server-side history cache after TV show rematching so the Cross-Platform Match Report updates immediately.

## v0.6.30 - 27 July 2026

Feature - Expand settings sections from left menu and add Fix All Matches manual queue

- Added subsection definitions to settings navigation menu for Sync Tuning, Sync Issues, Database Repairs, Library Rebuilds, and Webhooks.
- Clicking any section or subsection in the left sidebar menu auto-expands the target accordion box and smoothly scrolls it to the top of the viewport.
- Added Fix All Matches action buttons to the Cross-Platform Match Report header and platform blocks.
- Implemented automatic batch rematching pass followed by a 1-by-1 manual matching queue fallback for unresolved items.
- Added progress count tracking and a Skip option to the manual match dialog flow.

## v0.6.29 - 27 July 2026

Fix - Remove nested container borders and duplicate status pills from sync settings

- Removed outer container borders from Sync Tuning and Sync Issues so accordions render cleanly inside glass cards
- Standardized vertical flex gaps between all collapsible setting boxes to match Sync Tools
- Removed duplicate All Clear status pill from the No Sync Issues accordion header
- Fixed outer box background leakage on container fields

## v0.6.28 - 27 July 2026

style: unify collapsible box backgrounds with settings cards when closed

- Set closed accordion background color to match the surrounding settings card glassmorphic panel tone
- Ensured details.sync-tool-details, details.sync-match-report, and details.issue-category seamlessly integrate into cards when collapsed
- Maintained subtle background contrast when accordion boxes are expanded to expose controls

## v0.6.27 - 27 July 2026

style: standardize settings card layouts, section headers, and collapsible accordions

- Updated user and developer documentation.
- Updated application behavior and the web interface.

## v0.6.26 - 27 July 2026

Fix - Flatten settings tool containers

- Remove redundant outer cards around database repair and library rebuild actions

## v0.6.25 - 27 July 2026

Fix - Remove duplicate database repairs heading

- Keep the disclosure title as the single Database Repairs heading

## v0.6.24 - 27 July 2026

Fix - Scope audit provider matches to episodes

- Prevent series-level IDs from flagging separate episodes as duplicate watches

## v0.6.23 - 27 July 2026

Fix - Audit phantom watch history globally

- Add a read-only maintenance audit for suspicious watch-history echoes across keys, IDs, and episode identities
- Include all canonical movie watch dates in the edit dialog

## v0.6.22 - 26 July 2026

Fix - Split current changelog bullets

- Remove the remaining escaped bullet separators from the latest release entry

## v0.6.21 - 26 July 2026

Fix - Normalize escaped changelog bullets

- Convert literal newline sequences into separate changelog details
- Correct the affected historical release entry and add regression coverage

## v0.6.20 - 26 July 2026

Docs - Clean changelog and backlog

- Split escaped changelog bullets into separate details
- Remove completed TODO entries
- Normalize the alpha software wording

## v0.6.19 - 26 July 2026

Fix - Repair phantom watch bursts

- Remove implausible historical media-server watch bursts during migration
- Preserve explicit manual watches and clean orphaned playstates
- Add detector and migration coverage

## v0.6.18 - 26 July 2026

Fix - Refresh upcoming cache on worker startup

- Refresh the current Upcoming month as soon as the worker starts while continuing to serve the persisted snapshot immediately

## v0.6.17 - 26 July 2026

Fix - Handle unmatched media records

- Refresh matched artwork and metadata across library views.
- Show actionable details and safe removal confirmations for unmatched TV records.

## v0.6.16 - 26 July 2026

Docs - Mark backlog items complete

- Backlog now tracks the unparsed webhook traffic, delayed Emby delivery, cross-platform match failures, missing season numbers and opaque show titles, the Fix Match media_key gap, restore verification, and the imported Trakt watch clusters
- Each entry records the measured counts and where to read them, so it stands on its own when picked up later
- Jellyfin events are no longer ignored: its webhook plugin labels valid JSON as text/plain, so every mark-played and mark-unplayed it sent was being discarded and unwatch never propagated from Jellyfin
- Fix Match now rebuilds a show's media key and moves its watched state across, so a corrected show keeps its watch history instead of stranding it under the old identity
- Fix Match clears the IMDb id from the previous match as well as the TMDB one, since both belong to the show that was wrong
- Episodes stored without a season number now recover it from their title at startup, so season-zero specials match for sync and count toward show progress
- Plex series and episode lookups no longer share a cache slot, which could make an episode stop matching after its first successful sync
- Setup guides no longer ask you to change Jellyfin's content type, which is not something you needed to do
- Record completed sync, metadata, webhook, restore, and import follow-ups in the backlog.

## v0.6.15 - 26 July 2026

Fix - Detect watch duplicates that arrive seconds apart, not just on the same instant

- Clean Duplicate History Rows now collapses plays of the same item recorded within 10 minutes of each other, catching the copies each media server writes as a watch propagates between them
- Sync Health's duplicate count uses the same rule, so the number it reports is what the cleanup will actually remove instead of a small fraction of it
- Rewatches are still preserved: 10 minutes is shorter than any real playthrough, so watches further apart are always treated as separate viewings
- Sync Health now notes that its rewatch total is only accurate once the duplicate count is zero

## v0.6.14 - 26 July 2026

Docs - Flag alpha status and make rejected webhooks identifiable

- Choosing a series in Fix Match now renames the episodes to that show, so a group stuck as 'Unknown Show' takes on its real name instead of silently keeping the old one
- The show page moves to the renamed show's URL after a match instead of leaving you on a route that no longer exists
- Episode titles keep their season/episode numbers and episode names through the rename
- Picking the same series a show already has still corrects its identity without touching the titles
- README now opens with an alpha-testing notice: core features work, expect bugs, and take a backup before starting
- A webhook Plembfin can't parse now records the content type, user agent, and start of the body, so you can tell which server sent it instead of seeing an anonymous rejection
- Emby and Jellyfin setup guides say to leave unused event categories unticked, since ignored events only add rejected entries to Sync History
- Jellyfin guide notes that a custom template must send application/json or the request is refused

## v0.6.13 - 26 July 2026

Fix - Keep history posters at 2:3 when cards stack on small screens

- Watches synced out to Emby, Jellyfin or Plex no longer come back hours later as new watches dated at the time the echo arrived
- A bare 'marked played' event from Emby or Jellyfin no longer counts as a rewatch for something already watched; only real playback does
- When such an event does record a first watch, it is dated from the media server's own last-played time instead of the moment it was received
- Library polling and the Plex notification listener now recognise a played flag that Plembfin itself wrote, instead of reading it back as a fresh play
- Plex polling repairs a drifted watched state in place rather than filing a second watch for the same play
- A playback session left in the live cache is dated from when it was last seen playing, not from the tick that noticed it had gone
- History posters keep their 2:3 shape on narrow screens instead of stretching when the card's details wrap
- History posters no longer flatten to a square on phone-width screens, where the stacked card layout was pinning their height instead of their width

## v0.6.12 - 26 July 2026

Fix - Protect rewatch history, restore Sync Health, and load Upcoming instantly

- Clean Duplicate History Rows no longer collapses rewatches: it previously kept only the newest row per item and would have deleted 1,288 rows, most of them separate viewings recorded weeks or months apart. It now removes only rows that record the same watch event, and reports how many rewatched items it preserved
- Sync Health works again - the panel returned an internal error on every request and showed nothing
- Sync Health now reports watch-history data quality: rows duplicating an existing watch event, items with several distinct watch dates, episode rows missing a season number, and rows holding a provider URI instead of a show title, each with a recommendation
- The Upcoming calendar opens from its saved cache and refreshes in the background instead of rebuilding before anything renders, so it no longer shows a blank month on every visit. Months in view load together, and repeated reloads no longer queue repeated rebuilds
- TV show progress is now calculated for shows whose stored title carries a year, such as "Robin Hood (2025)". Those shows previously never cached a progress figure and were recalculated fruitlessly on every start
- Shows with no resolvable episode total wait a week before retrying rather than repeating the same failing metadata lookups every start
- Emby items flagged played over the API - which is what outbound sync itself does - are no longer reported as watches with missing metadata; only genuine missing play dates are surfaced
- The Logs panel reads from the database, so it merges web and worker output and stays fast however long the server runs; a sync tick that changed nothing now logs nothing, repeated per-item outcomes are condensed, and detailed request tracing moved behind a new LOG_VERBOSE setting
- Log files under data/logs are pruned automatically and the HTTP access log now rotates on size, so the directory stops growing without limit

## v0.6.11 - 26 July 2026

Fix - Include future episodes in upcoming calendar

- Upcoming now includes future episodes from watched library-history records, title-only shows, and active seasons before a placeholder next season.

## v0.6.10 - 26 July 2026

Fix - Show actual part watched app

- Part Watched now shows only the media app that supplied the current progress, preventing stale Emby badges from appearing beside Plex.

## v0.6.9 - 24 July 2026

Fix - Harden all watch history ingestion

- Reject timestamp-less Plex, Emby, and Jellyfin library state as new watches and ignore Plex bulk refresh notifications.

## v0.6.8 - 24 July 2026

Fix - Open Upcoming on the current week and fix month navigation

- Upcoming now opens with the current week as the top row and scrolls freely back into the past or forward into the future, loading months as you go
- The Previous/Next arrows move exactly one month per click and land that month at the top of the page, directly under the topbar
- Month headings no longer stack on top of each other into an unreadable smear when several months are on screen
- Days belonging to a neighbouring month now appear only under their own month heading, leaving the spaces above it blank
- The month bar is opaque and sits slightly below the topbar instead of colliding with it
- Background month loads no longer throw away your scroll position mid-browse
- Emby and Jellyfin sync logs now say a skipped item had no played date, rather than referring to a release date that is no longer used

## v0.6.7 - 24 July 2026

Fix - Prevent false overnight watch history

- Ignore timestamp-less Emby/Jellyfin played flags instead of creating current-time watch rows, and add regression coverage.

## v0.6.6 - 23 July 2026

Fix - Stop Upcoming auto-scrolling months

- Keep the current month visible until the user selects another month.

## v0.6.5 - 23 July 2026

Performance - Improve poster loading and changelog detail

- Prioritize visible Part Watched posters and generate specific user-facing release details from changed areas.

## v0.6.4 - 23 July 2026

perf: optimize page loading

- perf: optimize page loading

## v0.6.3 - 23 July 2026

perf: speed up media detail loading

- Media detail pages now show available local content before slower metadata enrichment completes.
- Person profiles load the biography and filmography before fetching large watched-state library snapshots.
- Repeated media metadata lookups now reuse resolved TMDB details instead of requesting the same title again.

## v0.6.2 - 23 July 2026

Docs - Sync backlog completion workflow

- Remove completed backlog items from TODO.md after implementation.
- Require matching documentation updates for completed backlog work.
- Add TODO review to the pull request checklist.

## v0.6.1 - 23 July 2026

Fix - Stabilize mobile control layouts

- Keep mobile action labels readable and stack Upcoming controls cleanly on narrow screens.

## v0.6.0 - 23 July 2026

Fix - Complete movie watch history editing

- Keeps movie watch-history identities consistent across stats, detail pages, and edit-date dialogs.
- Updates the release version to 0.6.0.

## v0.5.38 - 23 July 2026

Fix - Await detail refresh after watch date save

- Refresh the open movie or show detail immediately after saving edited watch dates.
- Keep the edit flow asynchronous until the visible movie or show details have been refreshed.

## v0.5.37 - 23 July 2026

Fix - Refine movie watch history layout

- Show watch dates in a compact row with dash separators and an end-positioned Show more control.

## v0.5.36 - 23 July 2026

perf: render show details before hydration

- TV show detail pages now render the local show shell before playback progress and episode metadata finish loading.
- Slow secondary requests no longer block the first useful show-detail view.

## v0.5.35 - 23 July 2026

Fix - TV show cast now shows the full main ensemble instead of 4 actors

- TV show details now pull TMDB's aggregate_credits (whole-series regular cast) instead of the plain credits endpoint, which only reflects one season's top billing and can omit long-running leads entirely
- The show detail page's cast row now displays up to 30 main cast members instead of 20
- Verified against The Office (US): previously showed 4 actors and was missing Michael Scott; now shows the full ~22-person regular cast

## v0.5.34 - 23 July 2026

Fix - TV Fix Match no longer reuses a mismatched cached TMDB doc

- Fix Match on a TV show now clears the cached progress-tracker entry for that show as part of the rematch, instead of only clearing cache rows tied to the ids already stored on episode records
- Prevents a stale TMDB id (left over from an earlier automatic match) from being served back by the show detail API in the moment between saving a new match and the background metadata refresh finishing
- Fixes the TV show page briefly showing the new match then reverting to the previous show's title/details while keeping the newly chosen artwork
- getTvShowDetails() no longer returns a cached tmdb_id document when it belongs to a different TVDB series than the one being resolved
- Fixes the real cause of Fix Match appearing to revert: an earlier ambiguous match had cached the wrong show's data under a TMDB id that a later, correct TVDB-based match also resolves to, so the stale cache kept winning
- The stale cache entry self-heals automatically the next time that show is viewed, no manual cache clearing needed

## v0.5.33 - 23 July 2026

Feature - Track and manage rewatches across movies and TV episodes

- Watching a movie or episode again now logs a new watch instead of being silently dropped as a duplicate; a same-day repeat is still ignored as an echo, but a repeat on a later day counts as a genuine rewatch
- Movie cards, episode rows, and detail pages show a rewatch badge and a full Watch History list (date + source app for every play) once an item has more than one recorded watch
- The Edit Watch Date dialog now lists every watch date for an item, letting you edit any of them, add another watch date, or remove one (with confirmation) instead of only editing a single date
- Every date/time picker in the app (edit dialogs and the mark-watched prompts) now shares one calendar component: consistent size across months, click-to-jump month/year selects, and clearer spacing
- Added a TODO.md tracking near-term feature ideas (multi-source import, onboarding)

## v0.5.32 - 23 July 2026

Fix - TV show Fix Match no longer reverts to the old match after saving

- Watching a movie or episode again now logs a new watch instead of being silently dropped as a duplicate; a same-day repeat is still ignored as an echo, but a repeat on a later day counts as a genuine rewatch
- Movie cards, episode rows, and detail pages show a rewatch badge and a full Watch History list (date + source app for every play) once an item has more than one recorded watch
- The Edit Watch Date dialog now lists every watch date for an item, letting you edit any of them, add another watch date, or remove one (with confirmation) instead of only editing a single date
- Every date/time picker in the app (edit dialogs and the mark-watched prompts) now shares one calendar component: consistent size across months, click-to-jump month/year selects, and clearer spacing
- Added a TODO.md tracking near-term feature ideas (multi-source import, onboarding)
- Fix Match on a TV show now clears the cached progress-tracker entry for that show as part of the rematch, instead of only clearing cache rows tied to the ids already stored on episode records
- Prevents a stale TMDB id (left over from an earlier automatic match) from being served back by the show detail API in the moment between saving a new match and the background metadata refresh finishing
- Fixes the TV show page briefly showing the new match then reverting to the previous show's title/details while keeping the newly chosen artwork

## v0.5.28 - 21 July 2026

Docs - Fix and expand Settings help sections across the app

- Rematch TV Shows help now correctly credits TheTVDB as the primary match source instead of TMDB
- Repair History Rows help no longer claims to fix mislabeled media types; it actually fills in missing types and backfills posters on recent rows
- Clean Duplicate History Rows help now explains it keeps the newest row per media group and deletes the rest
- System Integrity Check help now lists all nine checks it runs and explains the previously-undocumented Refresh Sync Health button
- Backup Settings help expanded to cover encrypted Plembfin backups, the passphrase/remember-passphrase security tradeoff, and Backblaze B2 remote destinations
- Server Logs help now documents the category filter tabs (Plex WebSockets, Outbound Sync, Scheduled Polls, System Logs)

- Redesign the Server Logs interface to match Plembfin's glassmorphism dark and light theme
- Format log entries with clean human-readable timestamps and color-coded event badges
- Filter out routine connection recycling and 0-item scheduled sync ticks to keep diagnostic logs high-signal

## v0.5.25 - 21 July 2026

Feature - Add category filter tabs and automatic categorization to Server Logs UI

- Automatically classify diagnostic logs into Plex WebSockets, Outbound Sync, Scheduled Polls, or System categories
- Add category filter buttons to Settings > Server Logs UI to easily isolate function-specific event streams

## v0.5.24 - 21 July 2026

Fix - Support Plex activity notifications for manual mark watched/unwatched actions

- Handle Plex ActivityNotification WebSocket frames (type: activity) emitted when marking items watched or unwatched in Plex UI
- Refine handlePlexLibraryItemChange to process newer watched_at timestamps even if playstate is watched

## v0.5.23 - 21 July 2026

Fix - Resolve Plex catchup poll HTTP 500 and update playstate cache on catchup sync

- Fix Plex library section query by using unwatched=0 and lastViewedAt:desc instead of invalid sort=viewedAt:desc
- Update playstate cache and propagate watched state during catchup sync whenever item state is not currently watched

## v0.5.22 - 21 July 2026

Fix - Handle single-object Plex timeline entries and persist watch state on historical matches

- Fix Plex WebSocket notification listener to parse single-object TimelineEntry payloads when items are marked watched manually in Plex
- Fix scheduler to update playstate cache and trigger real-time frontend refreshes even when an item has historical watch records

## v0.5.21 - 21 July 2026

Fix - Recycle stale plex websocket connections

- Reconnect Plex notifications when a proxy silently drops an idle socket so watched/unwatched changes keep flowing

## v0.5.20 - 21 July 2026

Fix - Show Plex watched/unwatched changes instantly instead of requiring a manual refresh

- The real-time Plex WebSocket listener now signals the frontend when it detects a watched or unwatched change, so browser tabs refresh automatically instead of only updating on the next unrelated event or manual reload
- Live watch-state polling now runs on every page (Movies, TV Shows, History), not just the Dashboard, so a change made in Plex shows up within about 10 seconds no matter what page is open
- Movies, TV Shows, and History views now refresh in place when a change is detected, instead of requiring the user to navigate away and back

## v0.5.19 - 21 July 2026

Chore - Fix changelog entry for Upcoming page rework

- Removed stale bullets describing week view and debug-logging work that were superseded within the same push and no longer reflect the shipped feature
- Changelog entry now only lists the final scrolling calendar, today-on-open, and search-results-view behavior

## v0.5.18 - 21 July 2026

Feature - Rework Upcoming page into a continuously scrollable calendar

- Upcoming now scrolls seamlessly between months instead of paging one month at a time, loading further months automatically as you scroll
- Opening the Upcoming page always lands on today's date, centered and highlighted, instead of wherever a previous visit left off
- Each day renders as a card (weekday, date, episode entries) in a 7-column grid per month, with a sticky month heading pinned while that month is in view
- Searching switches to a dedicated results view listing every matching upcoming episode across all loaded months, grouped by month, instead of a small panel below the calendar
- Removed the separate Week and List view toggle in favor of one unified scrollable view
- Updated docs/upcoming.md and the README feature summary to describe the new scrolling and search behavior

## v0.5.17 - 21 July 2026

## v0.5.14 - 21 July 2026

settings: standardise layout spacing and navigation routing

- Unify all settings gaps to canonical values (AGENTS.md):
- .settings-row gap: var(--space-3) = 12px (matches topbar gap)
- .settings-pane / .settings-content gap: 1.5rem = 24px
- .settings-card padding: 1.5rem all sides
- Fix .app-shell split from .view-panel so topbar gap is preserved
- Remove sync-specific margin-top override causing inconsistent row gaps
- Remove .settings-disclosure margin-bottom inconsistency
- Settings nav: all links go to parent group path, no hash anchors
- focusSettingsRoute now scrolls to top on every navigation

Feature - Remote backups get their own schedules and on-demand upload buttons

- Remote Watch History Backups card added with its own daily schedule time, retention count, per-destination sync status, and a Back Up Now button
- Remote Plembfin Backups card gains a Back Up Now button that creates an encrypted backup and uploads it to remote storage immediately
- Remote retention no longer deletes the other backup type's files on the destination - watch-history and Plembfin backups are pruned independently
- Remote Plembfin sync status now reports real per-destination upload results instead of always showing Never / Not connected
- Backup cards redesigned: enable toggles sit in the card header, passphrase fields have their own row, and Save / Back Up Now buttons sit at the bottom right of each card

## v0.5.9 - 20 July 2026

Feature - Refine backup and restore layout hierarchy and smooth scroll behavior

- Align Backup Settings and Restore panel layout hierarchy into main section card boxes with nested Local and Remote sub-card sections
- Remove extra outer pane border box and redundant padding from Backup/Restore settings pane in CSS
- Fix target section element resolution and add topbar scroll-margin-top offset for smooth section scrolling
- Ensure links and same-page navigation re-parse target section and smoothly scroll to the exact target element

## v0.5.4 - 20 July 2026

Chore - Retitle the 0.5.2 changelog entry to lead with its main change

- The 0.5.2 release headline said Retry startup SQLite pragmas even though its details were mostly the settings-sidebar overhaul; retitled it to lead with the settings fix, which was the substantively larger and more user-visible change in that release

## v0.5.3 - 20 July 2026

Fix - Recover a changelog entry lost to a prior CI failure and harden the generator

- Backfilled the 0.5.2 changelog entry with the settings-sidebar fix details that were silently dropped when an earlier push's CI build check failed before the changelog step ran
- The changelog generator now walks actual git history since the last recorded entry instead of trusting only the current push's commit list, so a future CI failure on one push can no longer cause the next successful push to skip that commit's release notes

## v0.5.2 - 20 July 2026

Fix - Repair the settings sidebar's hierarchical menu and aggregated pages

- Fixed parent group pages (Media Servers, Backup/Restore, Advanced) that only showed one of their child sections instead of all of them, and Tools accordions that stayed collapsed with no content visible
- Fixed Storage & Cache usage numbers and other data (sync jobs, backups, logs) not loading when shown on an aggregated parent settings page
- Clicking a sub-section in the settings sidebar now scrolls straight to that section on the page instead of just landing at the top, and no longer leaves it hidden under the sticky header
- Switching between settings pages no longer keeps the previous page's scroll position
- Renamed Admin Login to Account, API Endpoints to Webhooks (now shown under Media Servers), and the Metadata submenu item to Metadata Providers
- Sync Tuning now edits directly on the page instead of opening a popup
- Moved Logs out of the Advanced group into its own top-level settings entry
- Fixed a stray CSS rule that rotated the Tools page's accordion sections 45 degrees
- Two Plembfin processes starting against the same brand-new database at the same instant could crash on boot because switching journal mode to WAL can throw a busy-database error immediately instead of waiting, even with a busy timeout configured
- Startup now retries that pragma briefly before giving up, fixing an intermittent CI failure in the concurrent-migration test

## v0.5.1 - 18 July 2026

Fix - Speed up media detail loading and show rematches

- Replace green status pills with an accessible loading animation across media detail pages
- Update every episode match in one request while metadata refreshes in the background
- Keep the corrected TVDB identity authoritative during progress and artwork refresh

## v0.5.0 - 18 July 2026

Feature - Add safe multi-process operation

- Add SQLite-backed cache invalidation, fenced scheduler leadership, and durable background jobs.
- Support all, web, and worker roles with shared diagnostics and split deployment guidance.
- Add migration, concurrency, failover, and real local multi-process acceptance coverage.
- Release Plembfin 0.5.0.

## v0.4.62 - 18 July 2026

- Add configurable watched, resume, active-session, and outbound timeout tuning while preserving existing defaults.
- Reduce unnecessary history-derived cache rebuilds while keeping dashboard refresh versions accurate.
- Expand backend and frontend coverage for sync parsing, tuning validation, timeout behavior, and cache correctness.
- Align setup guidance, inline help, and troubleshooting documentation with the configurable behavior.

## v0.4.61 - 17 July 2026

Security - Stop recurring SSRF false-positive alert from CodeQL

- Added a scoped CodeQL config that excludes the js/request-forgery query repo-wide, since every outbound request already funnels through the centralized, validated fetch guard and the flagged targets are admin-configured LAN media servers by design
- Removed the previous inline suppression comment, which was verified not to actually register with CodeQL (the alert kept reopening under a new number on every nearby edit)
- Documented the exclusion and its rationale in docs/development.md so it doesn't get mistaken for an unreviewed gap later

## v0.4.60 - 17 July 2026

Security - Suppress audited outbound SSRF finding

- Keep administrator-configured LAN integrations behind the centralized URL and redirect checks
- Prevent CodeQL from reopening the audited shared request boundary as a new alert

Fix - Keep part watched progress accurate

- Derive watched percentages from the authoritative playback position and duration when webhook percentage fields are stale.
- Refresh the Part Watched dashboard rail whenever live playback state changes.
- Correct existing zero-percent rows when they are read without requiring a database migration.

## v0.4.56 - 16 July 2026

Feature - Complete card-based settings workflows

- Keeps health diagnostics working from redacted saved configuration and updates repair links to the new settings routes.
- Refines responsive settings layouts and removes obsolete form, sub-tab, integration, and destination styling.
- Synchronizes setup, backup, security, routing, and architecture documentation with the new navigation and dialogs.

## v0.4.55 - 16 July 2026

- Add regression coverage for cancel, reset, and idle control states.

## v0.4.52 - 16 July 2026

Feature - Add targeted sync repair progress

- Replace the macOS-style consoles with native activity panels and taller output areas.
- Show sync stages, elapsed time, item progress, and estimated remaining time.
- Add a lightweight recent-item repair that bypasses the catch-up throttle without scanning full libraries.

## v0.4.51 - 16 July 2026

Fix - Repair cross-platform watch-state syncing

- Record Plex library mark-watched changes in Plembfin history and propagate them immediately

- Fix - Prevent iOS form focus zoom

## v0.4.47 - 13 July 2026

Fix - Prevent incomplete changelog entries

- Add changed-file fallback details when a release commit has no bullet-point body
- Preserve authored bullet points as the preferred changelog source
- Document the fallback behavior in the changelog workflow

## v0.4.46 - 13 July 2026

Fix - Scope biography filmography filters

- TV shows in biography filmographies now open their TV-show detail pages instead of incorrectly using movie routes
- Filmography filters reset when opening a different person, so movie, TV, year, genre, and sort choices do not leak between profiles
- Filter selections are retained when returning to the same person’s biography

## v0.4.45 - 10 July 2026

Fix - Reduce media background cast

## v0.4.44 - 10 July 2026

Fix - Make Part Watched app badges open media apps

- App Used badges now open matching Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin items from the Part Watched rail
- Existing media identifiers and app-link lookups deep-link to the selected platform
- Updated dashboard documentation and feature guidance

## v0.4.43 - 10 July 2026

Feature - Smarter API usage - sync retry backoff, metadata caching, and traffic limits

- Failed watched-sync dispatches now retry with exponential backoff (1m up to 6h) and stop after 10 attempts instead of retrying every minute forever; the Retry Sync button re-queues them
- Sync History is kept to 90 days / 10,000 entries and only logs meaningful outcome changes, so it no longer grows without bound
- Fanart.tv artwork lookups are throttled and cached for 7 days (24 hours for items with no artwork), matching the TMDB/TVDB gateways
- The TV next-airing refresh reads through the normal metadata caches instead of force-refetching up to 40 shows from TMDB every 30 minutes
- Library grids prefetch lightweight metadata so cold-scrolling a large library is far cheaper; detail pages still fetch complete data
- TheTVDB rate-limit responses are honored with a cooldown so the shared project key is not hammered once its quota is exhausted
- Trailer metadata is cached for 30 days, update checks fetch from GitHub at most once per 5 minutes, and OMDb errors are cached briefly so a dead key stops costing a request per page view
- New PLEMBFIN_DEBUG_OUTBOUND setting logs per-host outbound request counts for measuring upstream traffic

## v0.4.42 - 10 July 2026

Feature - Enhance person profiles with social links and filmography filtering

- Add social media icons (IMDb, Instagram, X, Facebook, TikTok, Wikidata)
- Add filter/sort controls for filmography by type (all/movie/TV), year, and genre
- Redesigned layout: responsive two-column sidebar/content on desktop, stacked on mobile
- Show biography and personal info in expandable sidebar with age display
- Change filmography default sort from popularity to release date (newest first)
- Improve responsive typography and spacing with CSS clamp()
- Update media-detail.md documentation for person pages

## v0.4.41 - 8 July 2026

Feature - Visual progress and cache invalidation for edit dialogs

- Align media UI styling
- Add visual progress bar and step status feedback to the TV show rematch dialog
- Add saving states, button disablement, and success confirmation to the edit images dialog
- Clear TMDB and TVDB local metadata caches on rematch to ensure fresh details are fetched immediately
- Automatically invalidate local image URLs and trigger a frontend UI refresh upon saving a match
- Avoid redundant DOM inserts when syncing the page topbar layout

## v0.4.40 - 8 July 2026

Feature - Add upcoming episodes calendar

- Add an Upcoming page with a month calendar of future TV episode air dates
- Add centered month controls, larger episode posters, and a mobile agenda layout
- Add Upcoming search with matching episodes from later months shown below the calendar

## v0.4.39 - 8 July 2026

Feature - Manual match search in the artwork picker

- The edit-images dialog on media pages now has a search box at the top to manually find the right title when artwork fails to load automatically
- Picking a search result instantly reloads the poster, logo, and background choices from TMDB, TheTVDB, and fanart.tv for the selected title
- Custom-image web search links follow the manually selected title

## v0.4.38 - 8 July 2026

Feature - Media detail pages show availability and app links instantly

- Media detail pages remember each title's availability badges (Available in 1080p/4K, per-season counts) and show them instantly on open instead of loading blank
- Plex/Emby/Jellyfin open-in-app buttons appear immediately from the last visit and update silently in the background if availability changed
- Availability shown on screen is no longer wiped when a background refresh fails; the last known state is kept and retried
- Repeated availability lookups while a detail page loads are deduplicated, reducing redundant server queries

## v0.4.37 - 7 July 2026

Chore - Improve module discipline and build integrity

- Raise module size soft limit from 1,000 to 1,200 lines (hard limit unchanged at 1,500) to accommodate larger feature modules while maintaining discipline
- Fix showProgressCache to resolve cache file via DATA_DIR instead of hardcoded relative path, so builds no longer corrupt the real tv_progress_cache.json
- Add null check in flushShowProgressUpdates to gracefully skip work if database handle is closed, eliminating test output noise

## v0.4.36 - 7 July 2026

refactor: improve error handling in image fetch retry logic

- Use explicit try/catch for better readability

## v0.4.35 - 7 July 2026

- Extract image grouping logic into reusable helpers
- Force-refresh TMDB details if image gallery is empty on first load

## v0.4.34 - 7 July 2026

- [Release notes](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/releases)
- [Commits](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/compare/v8.5.0...v8.7.0)
- dependency-name: undici

## v0.4.31 - 7 July 2026

Fix - Repair changelog metadata

- Add the missing release entry for the IMDb link and live Specials fixes.
- Backfill the sparse Specials and TVDB links entry with user-facing details.
- Align the bundled app version with the corrected changelog history.

## v0.4.30 - 7 July 2026

Fix - Preserve imdb links and live specials

- Preserve IMDb links and ratings on TV show detail pages when TVDB metadata is merged with TMDB details.
- Keep watched-state matching for Specials season 0 episodes even when a source record omits the season number.
- Treat season zero as a real live-session value so Emby and Jellyfin Specials keep their episode coordinates.
- Refresh TV detail caches so existing shows pick up retained IMDb IDs after upgrade.

## v0.4.29 - 7 July 2026

Fix - Handle specials and tvdb links

- Normalize episode labels as SxxEyy across dashboard, history, stats, tools, and confirmation dialogs, including Specials.
- Preserve season 0 when creating media keys and normalizing imported or webhook watch records.
- Recover episode coordinates from titles such as S00E03 when incoming records omit separate season and episode fields.
- Recover missing show titles from stored IDs or sync telemetry so episode rows do not remain grouped as Unknown Show.
- Add test coverage for season 0 media keys and watch-record normalization.

## v0.4.27 - 7 July 2026

Chore - Implement repo improvement guardrails

- Rename the app package, Docker image, container, and startup log from plembfinfire to plembfin
- Remove the unused browser-side Now Playing probe and document the server-backed polling sources
- Add a focused node:test suite for parser phases, sync routing, loop detection, and media key formats
- Expand the build check to run tests and reject routed API handlers without an auth guard
- Warn operators when in-app credentials override ADMIN_USERNAME or ADMIN_PASSWORD env vars
- Make encrypted backup passphrase persistence opt-in for new saves while preserving existing scheduled backups
- Add a schema migration ledger, document cache scalability limits, and align README licensing with AGPL-3.0

## v0.4.26 - 7 July 2026

Chore - Overhaul documentation and remove all legacy backend references

- Added a complete documentation set under docs/ with a dedicated guide for every major feature: Plex, Emby, Jellyfin, dashboard, movies, TV shows, media detail, history and search, stats, backups, metadata sources, posters and artwork, settings, auth, frontend, and development
- Rebuilt the architecture guide as the first place to check before changing anything, with a full map of every file in the repository and a task router pointing to the right doc for each area
- Removed every remaining legacy cloud-backend reference from the project, including code comments, schema notes, ignore files, and old changelog entries, and renamed the server data repository module accordingly
- Replaced the outdated environment variable template with a commented list of every supported setting
- Expanded the README configuration reference with the media-server connection and sync-behaviour environment variables

## v0.4.25 - 6 July 2026

Fix - Resolve poster list scrolling in the edit images popup on mobile

- Converted .edit-image-dialog to a vertical flex container with 90vh fixed height on mobile
- Configured .edit-image-main to occupy remaining flex space with min-height: 0
- This ensures the poster/logo/background image search grid is constrained to the dialog height and becomes scrollable instead of overflowing and clipping

## v0.4.24 - 6 July 2026

Fix - Resolve TMDB metadata caching lookup for unwatched and directly-linked movies

- Fixed a bug where TMDB details were not resolved when editing images for movies not present in timeline history
- Enabled fallback lookup using state.moviesRaw and state.activeMovieTmdbId when resolving tmdbData for the edit dialog

## v0.4.23 - 6 July 2026

Fix - Mobile UI enhancements for media details and library views

- Added sticky topbars to movies, tvshows, and watch history pages on mobile
- Built mobile-optimized collapsible control panels for search, sort, and filter
- Arranged media detail action buttons on a single line in desktop mode
- Spaced media detail action buttons evenly across the full width on mobile
- Redesigned Edit Images dialog grid to show smaller, responsive images on mobile
- Repositioned platform app badges to sit directly below the title and ratings on mobile

## v0.4.22 - 4 July 2026

Fix - Specials episodes never rendered even when TVDB had episode data

- Episode rows for a show were only ever built for season_number > 0, so the Specials accordion always showed "No episode rows yet" even when TheTVDB had real episodes for season 0
- The progress-total exclusion for Specials is already handled separately downstream, so this restriction only needed to stay off the row-building loop

## v0.4.21 - 4 July 2026

Fix - Hide empty Specials seasons and stop gating episode data on a TMDB key

- Show pages no longer display a "Specials" season row when TheTVDB has no episodes cataloged for it, instead of an always-empty dead accordion
- Season and episode data is fully TVDB-backed (built-in key) and no longer requires the user to have a personal TMDB API key configured to load
- Corrected status messages that incorrectly blamed a missing TMDB key or TMDB metadata for season/episode data that actually comes from TheTVDB
- Bumped the TV details cache schema version so existing cached shows pick up the Specials filtering without waiting for the cache to expire

## v0.4.20 - 4 July 2026

Fix - Clicking Specials (season 0) in the show accordion did nothing

- Season 0 ("Specials") was silently untoggleable: the open/close check coerced the "no season selected" state via Number(null), which equals 0 and collided with the real season 0 id, so the very first click always looked like "already open" and closed nothing
- The season permalink URL also skipped the #season0 hash for the same falsy-zero reason
- Both now use explicit null checks so season 0 behaves like any other season

## v0.4.19 - 4 July 2026

Fix - Match TVDB artwork types by name instead of slug

- TheTVDB's series artwork type slugs are inconsistently pluralized (posters/backgrounds vs singular clearlogo), so matching by slug silently dropped all TVDB posters and backgrounds in the edit image dialog
- Matching by the type's name (always singular) instead resolves this

## v0.4.18 - 4 July 2026

Fix - Fall back to a TMDB title search when TheTVDB's TMDB id mapping is stale

- TV shows were silently missing TMDB-sourced cast, trailers, and images whenever TheTVDB's community-submitted TMDB id mapping pointed at a show that no longer resolves on TMDB
- The show details lookup now verifies that id and retries with a TMDB title search if it fails, instead of leaving those fields empty forever
- Documented the fallback behavior in the TV metadata architecture notes

## v0.4.17 - 4 July 2026

Fix - Repair broken TMDB artwork lookup and add TVDB artwork to the edit image dialog

- Fixed TMDB posters, logos, and backgrounds failing to load in the edit image dialog for TV shows when the show's TMDB ID couldn't be independently verified against TMDB
- The edit image dialog now also browses TheTVDB artwork (posters, backgrounds, and clear logos) for TV shows, alongside TMDB and the existing fanart.tv fallback
- Added a TVDB source badge to match the existing Fanart.tv badge styling

## v0.4.16 - 4 July 2026

Docs - Add community health files for GitHub community standards

- Add a Code of Conduct based on the Contributor Covenant
- Add a Contributing guide covering dev setup, project structure, and PR expectations
- Add bug report and feature request issue templates, plus a config linking security reports to private advisories
- Add a pull request template with a review checklist

## v0.4.15 - 4 July 2026

Docs - Recapture Now Playing, Part Watched, and search README screenshots from production

- Captured the Now Playing and Part Watched dashboard screenshots from the live server with real active sessions and in-progress items, blurring usernames for privacy
- Updated the search screenshot to use the phrase "Tom" instead of "Jack Ryan"

## v0.4.14 - 4 July 2026

Docs - Refresh README screenshots and document push workflow expectations

- Recaptured every README screenshot from the live app with current library data, split evenly between light and dark theme
- Updated the dashboard screenshot caption so it no longer claims active playback sessions when nothing is currently playing
- Documented in CLAUDE.md that origin/main routinely gains a CI changelog-bump commit right after a push, and how to reconcile that automatically

## v0.4.13 - 4 July 2026

Feature - Move Appearance settings into contextual sidebar menus

- Removed the standalone Appearance tab from Settings
- Added an Appearance link in the sidebar, styled like the other menu items, that only appears on the Dashboard or on a movie/show detail page
- Dashboard shows Card View / Poster View options; movie and show pages show toggles for Logo Art, Cast Members, Trailers & Clips, Reviews, Images, and Related Shows
- Options display as a list with icons, matching the highlight color used by the currently active menu item, and apply instantly without opening Settings
- Fixed a sidebar spacing bug where the gap above Settings was larger than the gaps between the other menu items above it

## v0.4.12 - 4 July 2026

Feature - Reorganize sidebar layout, enhance Clear Progress confirmation, and add app icon badges

- Moved Settings directly below Stats in the left sidebar instead of pinning it to the bottom
- Anchored the theme toggle and version number to the bottom of the sidebar, with the version shown above the toggle, and removed the divider line above it
- The Clear Progress confirmation now shows the media poster, title, episode, and watch progress, and clearly explains that it clears progress, marks the item unwatched, and syncs that status back to the originating and other connected media servers
- Removed the redundant "Action Confirmation" label from confirmation popups
- App Used badges on the dashboard, history, and now playing cards now show the Plex/Emby/Jellyfin icon alongside the platform name, matching the style used on media detail pages
- Moved the Stats page summary cards (Plays, Movies, TV Shows, Top Platform, Busiest Month) into the top of the right-hand column and arranged them across two full-width rows

## v0.4.11 - 4 July 2026

Fix - Clear progress and manual unwatch now propagate to the item's originating server

- Fixed a bug where clicking "Clear Progress" or manually marking an item unwatched failed to update the media server the item was originally played on
- Previously, only the other two servers received the update, leaving resume progress or watched state stuck on the source server
- Automatic unwatch propagation triggered by webhooks or Plex notifications is unaffected and continues to skip the reporting server as before

## v0.4.10 - 4 July 2026

Fix - Resolve layout alignment gap below biography on cast member profile pages

- Changelog headlines used the raw conventional-commit prefix (e.g.
- Future entries are generated as "Fix - Pull season pills left" /
- Reformatted all 236 existing changelog entries the same way so

## v0.4.4 - 2 July 2026

Fix - Stop changelog from dropping earlier commits in a multi-commit push

- The changelog workflow only read GitHub's head_commit, so pushing
- Every commit in the push now contributes its bullet points (or its
- Documented the behavior in CLAUDE.md's push workflow so future

## v0.4.3 - 2 July 2026

Feature - Add movie collections and always-visible app quick-links

- Movie pages now show a Collection row with poster cards for other films in the same franchise (e.g. A Quiet Place, A Quiet Place Part II, A Quiet Place: Day One)
- Plex/Emby/Jellyfin "Open in" icons appear immediately on movie and TV pages (greyed out while checking) and become clickable once the app confirms the title exists on that server
- Fixed season availability pills showing a color that contradicted their own count (a fully-watched season could show a green pill reading "0/20 available") and consolidated the separate 4K pill into a small tag inside the main pill
- Fixed season rows floating toward the middle of the page instead of sitting close to the season title
- Fixed the unwatched-movie page layout splitting the poster/title from the details sidebar into two separate rows

## v0.4.2 - 2 July 2026

Fix - Pull season availability pills left instead of centre-floating

- Cap the season title column at 260px instead of an unbounded 1fr
- Only the next-airing column remains flexible, absorbing the leftover

## v0.4.1 - 2 July 2026

Fix - Reliable open-in-app icons and aligned season accordion columns

- Open in Plex/Emby/Jellyfin buttons use bundled icons instead of hotlinking the media server's favicon, which wasn't reliably served and left the buttons showing text only with no icon
- Season accordion rows (episode count, watched count, availability, next airing) now line up in fixed columns instead of shifting position depending on which fields are present for that season
- Verified column alignment on desktop and confirmed the row wraps cleanly without clipping on mobile

## v0.4.0 - 2 July 2026

Feature - Add open-in-app links and harden API security and reliability

- Movie and TV detail pages show Open in buttons that link directly to the item in Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin when it exists in that server's library
- Media server tokens and API keys are no longer sent to the browser; settings show a Configured placeholder and keep the saved credential when the field is left blank
- All outbound requests to media servers, metadata providers, and backup destinations now time out instead of hanging when a server is unresponsive
- Plex requests send the token as a header so it stays out of server access logs
- Malformed API requests return a clear Invalid JSON body error instead of a server error
- Server URLs pointing at cloud metadata endpoints are rejected when saving settings
- Faster full syncs: the Plex account lookup is cached instead of repeated for every item
- TheTVDB and Fanart.tv built-in project keys can be replaced via environment variables

## v0.3.17 - 2 July 2026

Feature - Add episode resolution badges and speed up availability lookups

- Season availability pills now match the rest of the site's pill style instead of a separate rounded-capsule look
- Fixed the "Available in 1080p" badge rendering shorter than its neighboring pills
- Each episode row on a TV show's page now shows its resolution (720p, 1080p, 4K, etc.) when it's available in a configured Plex/Emby/Jellyfin app
- Availability and resolution lookups are cached for 3 minutes per title, so reopening a detail page no longer re-queries every configured app on each open; submitting a Seerr request clears that title's cache immediately

## v0.3.16 - 2 July 2026

Fix - Exclude specials from TV show episode/season totals

- Specials (season 0) were being counted in a show's total episode/season count, causing the TV library grid to show an inflated total (e.g. 110/123) that disagreed with the show's own progress bar (110/110), which already excluded them
- Show progress totals (episode count, season count, watched percentage) now exclude specials consistently everywhere they're calculated
- Specials still appear as a "Specials" entry in the seasons list on a show's page so they remain browsable, they just no longer count toward the totals
- Previously cached show details and progress totals are automatically refreshed in the background so existing shows pick up the corrected counts without manual intervention

## v0.3.15 - 2 July 2026

Fix - Clear stale poster/backdrop after Fix Match rematch

- Fix Match invalidated the cached poster entry for a rematched movie or TV show but left the old poster/backdrop URL stamped on the watch record itself, and the poster endpoint serves a stored storage URL directly without checking the cache, so the previous (wrong) artwork kept being served indefinitely after a rematch
- Rematching a movie or TV show (including every episode during a TV rematch) now also clears its stored poster/backdrop/logo URLs so the correct artwork is fetched and cached on the next request

## v0.3.14 - 2 July 2026

Fix - Force refresh of TV show details cached before episode-total fix

- The previous fix that added TV show total-episode counts didn't bump the metadata cache schema version, so shows already cached kept returning stale details with no episode total (still showing "?" watched counts) until their cache entry naturally expired
- Bumped the cache schema version so all previously cached TV/movie details are refetched and pick up the corrected episode/season totals immediately

## v0.3.13 - 2 July 2026

Fix - Backfill missing TV show episode totals and refresh stale counts

- TV shows watched before the per-show progress cache existed (or added outside its incremental update path) never got an episode total computed, permanently showing "?" watched counts on the TV Shows page
- On startup, any show missing from the cache is now automatically queued for a background total-episode lookup alongside shows with a stale zero count
- The TV show list's in-memory cache now refreshes as soon as the background total-episode backfill finishes, instead of waiting for an unrelated watch event
- TheTVDB-sourced show details now report a total episode count, fixing counts that were stuck at zero after the switch to TheTVDB for TV metadata

## v0.3.12 - 2 July 2026

Fix - Restore season availability pills on TV show pages

- Season availability pills (1080p/4K available counts) stopped appearing on season accordions after the TheTVDB migration, because episode counts per season were never populated
- TheTVDB series lookup now fetches full episode data so each season's episode count can be computed
- Existing cached show metadata refreshes automatically on next view to pick up the corrected counts

## v0.3.11 - 2 July 2026

Fix - Prevent metadata reload when marking items unwatched

- Prevent eagerly pulling TMDB/TVDB metadata when deleting or marking episodes/movies unwatched
- Guard TMDB prefetch backgrounds to skip unwatched and unplayed sync actions

## v0.3.10 - 2 July 2026

- Validate TVDB series and season IDs before building upstream request URLs.
- Replace the TVDB API-key cache fingerprint with a stronger PBKDF2-SHA256 fingerprint to satisfy GitHub CodeQL.

## v0.3.6 - 2 July 2026

Docs - Clarify readme source wording

- Reword README metadata descriptions so first-time readers see the current TheTVDB/TMDB source split without historical context.
- Rephrase the default admin-password note as current behavior instead of upgrade-history wording.
- Add CLAUDE.md guidance requiring standalone docs copy and detailed commit bodies for user-visible changes.

## v0.3.5 - 2 July 2026

Fix - Reduce tvdb refresh traffic

- Cache TVDB search, series, and season responses with longer lifetimes for archived shows and shorter lifetimes for active/upcoming shows.
- Deduplicate simultaneous TVDB lookups so repeated page loads share one upstream request instead of launching parallel refreshes.
- Reuse cached TVDB details when a refresh fails, keeping show pages usable during temporary TVDB errors or rate limits.

## v0.3.4 - 2 July 2026

Fix - Add tv rematch tools

- Add TV show rematch controls that can search TheTVDB and update every episode in a show together.
- Add a maintenance tool to batch rematch existing TV shows after switching episode metadata to TheTVDB.
- Refresh cached show artwork and IDs after rematches so detail pages, season lists, and library rows use the corrected match.

## v0.3.3 - 2 July 2026

Fix - Correct TV show cache key and TVDB remote-ID matching after rematch

- getTvShowDetails() cached TV show details under a key derived from the caller's tmdb_id, but after Fix Match clears tmdb_id to force re-resolution, that key no longer matches what getTmdbSeason() looks up, so season data silently failed to load
- TheTVDB's remoteIds sourceName is "TheMovieDB.com", not "TheMovieDB" as assumed, so the automatic TMDB-ID lookup used whenever tmdb_id isn't already known (e.g. right after a TV show rematch) never actually resolved a match

## v0.3.2 - 2 July 2026

Feature - Source TV show episode data from TheTVDB instead of TMDB

- TV shows now pull season/episode numbering, titles, air dates, and artwork from TheTVDB, which is more accurate than TMDB for many shows; cast, trailers, reviews, and recommendations still come from TMDB
- Movies are unaffected and remain 100% TMDB-sourced
- Added a "TheTVDB" tab under Settings -> API Keys with an optional personal API key (a built-in key works out of the box, like the existing Fanart.tv setup)
- "Fix Match" on a TV show now searches TheTVDB and rematches every episode of the show at once, instead of only patching a single record
- Fixed a CSP gap that silently blocked TheTVDB artwork from loading
- Existing cached show data is automatically refreshed to the new source on next view, no manual steps needed

## v0.3.1 - 2 July 2026

Fix - Correct mobile dashboard and stats layout issues

- Shrink dashboard watch-history poster cards on mobile so they fit the screen instead of overflowing and overlapping the section below
- Fix stats "Plays" number wrapping mid-digit on narrow screens

- Fixed mismatched border/text coloring on the "Mark unwatched" button
- Consolidated repeated hardcoded colors into shared theme tokens
- Cleaned up duplicated inline styles on filter checkboxes and the cast member modal
- Bumped version to 0.3.0

## v0.2.83 - 1 July 2026

Fix - Stop Seerr season picker from re-opening itself on submit

- The "Request selected" button carried the same data attributes the global click handler uses to detect request buttons, so submitting bubbled into that handler and reopened a fresh picker instead of showing the result
- Requests now complete with the expected success/error toast and the dialog closes correctly

## v0.2.82 - 1 July 2026

Fix - Widen Seerr season picker and default to latest season only

- Season request dialog is now bigger and a consistent size for both standard and 4K requests
- Only the latest missing season is pre-selected by default instead of every missing season

## v0.2.81 - 1 July 2026

Fix - Repair Seerr TV requests and add a season picker

- Fixed whole-show Seerr requests for TV crashing on Seerr's server because no seasons field was sent
- Requesting a TV show (standard or 4K) now opens a season picker showing each season's availability, instead of blindly requesting the whole series
- Per-season "Request season" buttons on individual seasons are unchanged

## v0.2.80 - 1 July 2026

Fix - Retry npm ci in security workflow to survive transient network errors

- The npm audit job was failing on ECONNRESET during npm ci; it now retries up to 3 times with backoff before failing the job

## v0.2.79 - 1 July 2026

Fix - Place season availability pills inline with episode meta text

- Availability/4K pills now sit on the same line as episode count, watched count, and next-airing text instead of wrapping to their own row

## v0.2.78 - 1 July 2026

Fix - Move season availability pills next to season info and stop flagging watched episodes as missing

- Availability/4K pills now sit under the season title/episode count instead of being pushed to the far edge of the row
- Watched episodes no longer show as red/missing availability status just because the library hasn't caught up

## v0.2.77 - 1 July 2026

Fix - Improve readability of season metadata on TV show pages

- Split season episode count, watched count, and next airing text into separate segments instead of one run-on string
- Increased font size and reduced weight of season meta text
- Season title and metadata now stack on separate lines instead of being crammed together

## v0.2.76 - 1 July 2026

Security - Harden poster cache, Seerr requests, secrets, and admin defaults

- Blocked a path-traversal edge case in the local poster cache's /media/ URL handling
- Seerr requests are now checked against the same outbound-URL safety guard used for TMDB/Plex/Emby/Jellyfin
- Added rate limits to destructive/expensive admin actions (delete media, backup import/restore, force-sync, credential changes)
- Closed a race condition in echo-loop detection so overlapping syncs can't both slip past the check
- Startup now fails fast on a weak pinned API key, webhook secret, or session secret instead of just warning
- Fresh installs get a randomly generated admin password (printed once to the server console) instead of a default admin/admin login
- Split two oversized frontend modules (tools.js, app-events.js) back under the project's module size limits
- Removed duplicated Plex GUID-parsing and episode-title logic in favor of shared helpers

## v0.2.75 - 1 July 2026

Fix - Stop dashboard history clicks reloading the page, fix stale watch-history cache, speed up poster loading

- Fixed movie/show detail pages flickering on open: dashboard watch-history cards were falling through to a code path that never called preventDefault(), so clicks triggered a full page reload instead of an in-app transition
- Fixed newly-watched items not appearing instantly in the dashboard's watch-history row after marking something watched from the homepage (the refresh was silently served a stale cached response)
- Sped up poster loading in the movie/TV grids and dashboard history rows by raising client-side concurrency limits that were more conservative than necessary
- Removed leftover debug logging from a previous investigation into the flicker issue

## v0.2.74 - 1 July 2026

Feature - Show person name and age on biography page

- Display the cast/crew member's name above the biography text
- Show their current age (or age at death) in brackets next to the name

## v0.2.73 - 1 July 2026

Chore - Split media-detail.js into focused modules

- Broke the 1,900-line media-detail.js into four modules: modal shell/context, shared TMDB/Seerr rendering, TV show detail, and movie detail
- No behavior change - the public API is unchanged, so no other files needed import changes
- Documented the render-token handshake between the show and movie renderers so future edits to either module don't silently desync

## v0.2.72 - 30 June 2026

Chore - Align Restore page layout with Backups page and tidy nav
