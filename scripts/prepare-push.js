// One command for everything that must happen between the last product commit
// and `git push origin develop`.
//
// This exists because the three-command version was skipped. An agent reported
// "the worktree is clean, with one commit ready to push" and went straight for
// the push, leaving the develop changelog stale for the commit it was about to
// publish. The pre-push hook would have rejected it, so nothing broken reaches
// the remote, but the failure only surfaces at the push itself.
//
// Collapsing it to one step removes the three separate things there were to
// forget: running the rebuild, staging `public` alongside the manifest, and
// committing the result.
//
// Safe to run repeatedly. When the changelog is already current it commits
// nothing and says so.
