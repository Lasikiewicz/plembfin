# Contributing to Plembfin

Thanks for your interest in improving Plembfin. This is a self-hosted, single-maintainer
project, so please keep pull requests focused and read this guide before opening one.

## Before you start

- For anything beyond a small fix, open an issue first to discuss the change. This avoids
  wasted effort on approaches that don't fit the project's direction.
- Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicate work.
- Security vulnerabilities should **not** be reported as public issues — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Development setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # auto-reload dev server on http://localhost:5055
```

There are no automated tests or linters configured in this project — verify changes by
running the app locally and exercising the affected feature in the browser.

## Project structure

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for a full
breakdown of the server and frontend architecture, including:

- Frontend module boundaries (`public/modules/*.js`) and where new UI code belongs
- The webhook → sync data flow
- SQLite schema and data layer conventions

Please follow the existing module boundaries described there — `public/app.js` is an
orchestrator only, and new frontend logic should go in the most specific existing module for
that feature area.

## Making changes

- Keep pull requests scoped to a single feature or fix. Avoid bundling unrelated refactors.
- Match the existing code style (plain ES modules, no build step, no TypeScript, no framework).
- Update relevant documentation in `docs/` and `README.md` when behavior, setup, or
  configuration changes.
- Write clear commit messages describing the *why*, not just the *what*.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and verify them locally.
3. Open a pull request describing the change, the motivation, and how you tested it.
4. Be responsive to review feedback — this is a small project maintained in spare time, so
   reviews may take a few days.

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

Use the issue templates provided when opening a new issue. Include enough detail (Plex/Emby/
Jellyfin version, logs, steps to reproduce) for the maintainer to act on the report.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
